    "title": "A petrogenetic model for the origin of migmatites in the Assam-Meghalaya Gneissic Complex, Northeast India: Constraints from mineralogy with special reference to magnetite",
    "abstract": "The current work is dedicated to studying the occurrence of fine- to coarse-grained magnetite crystals in migmatites of Chandrapur area located in Guwahati, along the northern fringe of the Assam-Meghalaya Gneissic Complex, Northeast India. The objective of this contribution is to present a novel approach demonstrating the origin of magnetite in the migmatites of our study area. Field investigations reveal that the gneissic rocks within the study area are penetrated by numerous pegmatitic veins of varying sizes. The late Pan-African tectonothermal event is deemed responsible for the pegmatitic intrusions in the study area. The pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions estimated from the migmatites revealed that fluid-present partial melting of the thermally elevated gneissic rocks during the tectonothermal episode was driven by the intrusion of volatile-laden pegmatitic melts. Subsequently, the partially molten rocks mingled with the K-rich pegmatitic magma, resulting in a mixed rock now preserved as neosome. Petrographic examinations reveal that the neosome displayed different degrees of hybridization, as indicated by the extent of amphibole-biotite transformation. Higher degrees of hybridization led to more extensive replacement of amphibole by biotite. The neosomes are also characterized by fine- to coarse-grained magnetite crystals. Based on the findings of this work, we infer that the transfer of K 2 O from the pegmatite magma to the partially molten rocks or neosome assisted in the breakdown of amphibole to biotite. The replacement reaction of amphibole to biotite led to the liberation of FeO, which was subsequently converted into magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) in the prevailing oxidizing conditions. The presence of magnetite in the neosome reflects the dominance of an oxidizing environment during magma interaction and evolution."

    "title": "Geochemical fingerprints of apatite from the Qiongjiagang pegmatite-type lithium deposit, Himalaya",
    "abstract": "Lithium is a critical strategic metal with significant reserves in pegmatites, serving as the primary source for global Li production. Apatite has attracted increasing attention as an indicator in petrogenesis studies and for the exploration of ore deposits. In this study, we investigated the volatile compositions and major and trace elements of apatite from the Qiongjiagang pegmatite-type lithium deposit in Himalaya. Apatite derived from spodumene pegmatite exhibits relatively constant and high total rare earth element (ΣREE+Y) concentrations, ranging from 5899 to 8540 ppm. In contrast, apatite in barren pegmatite displays evidently lower (ΣREE+Y) concentrations, varying between 1345 and 3095 ppm. The REE patterns of apatite in spodumene pegmatite generally exhibit a flat shape [(La/Yb) N = 1.55–2.15)], with distinctively negative Eu anomalies (Eu N /Eu N * = 0.14–0.22), slightly positive Ce anomalies (Ce N /Ce N * = 1.03–1.13), and low Y/Ho ratios (28–30). By contrast, apatite in barren pegmatite shows middle rare earth element (MREE)-depleted downward-convex patterns [(La/Yb) N = 1.99–20.4)], strongly negative Eu anomalies (Eu N /Eu N * = 0.01–0.14), slightly positive Ce anomalies (Ce N /Ce N * = 1.10–1.24), and high Y/Ho ratios (30–55, with an average of 50). Overall, the high concentrations of ΣREE (and Y) and low Th/U and Y/Ho ratios can serve as diagnostic indicators to distinguish apatite in spodumene pegmatite from that in barren pegmatite. Furthermore, the flat REE pattern may represent a common feature of apatite from lithium deposits. Differences in the Ce and Eu anomalies between apatite from these two kinds of pegmatites likely reflect formation under different redox conditions. Consequently, based on calculations derived from apatite volatile compositions, the melt associated with spodumene pegmatite may contain higher water content compared to that of the barren one. Therefore, the mineralized pegmatite system may incorporate substantial amounts of H 2 O-rich fluids, which play a crucial role in lithium mineralization."

    "title": "Mineralogical and geochemical features of Sirginil phyllite group from Penjween area, Iraqi Kurdistan region: Implications for provenance and source-area weathering",
    "abstract": "The Sirginil Phyllite Group being outcropping in Penjween area is investigated to determine the provenance and weathering level of the source area. Petrographic investigation of the phyllites shows that they are almost homogeneous in composition and highly crenulated. The most prominent features are kink band structures and network fabrics, consisting mainly of fine-grained mineral assemblages of chlorite, muscovite, quartz, and plagioclase feldspar. The geochemical data indicate that the phyllite rocks represent precursors of shales and greywackes as their protolith, having undergone an intensive degree of chemical weathering without sorting. Additionally, the presence of graphite, as an indication of organic matter, points to quick transport and burial of the protolith sedimentary rocks, which originated from a unique source area. The average values of the chemical alteration index and chemical weathering index indicate that a high degree of weathering of the source materials occurred in a humid environment. The Th/U ratio, as well as the concentrations of Th and U, indicates a sedimentary origin and oxidizing conditions during sedimentation of the protolith rocks. The REE pattern coupled with prominent negative Eu anomaly and low Th/Sc ratios, as well as the plots of La/Sc versus Th/Sc, La/Yb versus La/Ce, and Th/Yb versus Ta/Yb, indicates a continental margin as the paleoenvironment of the sedimentary protolith. The Th/Sc ratios for the studied samples denote origin from a predominantly felsic igneous source, while the median Zr/Sc ratio indicates only a minor degree of sorting and zircon addition in all the studied samples."

    "title": "U–Pb zircon geochronology constraints on the contractional and extensional tectonics along the South Tibetan detachment system (STDS), Dhauliganga Valley, NW Himalaya",
    "abstract": "The South Tibetan detachment system (STDS), a dominant extensional fault system in the Himalayan orogen, separates the Greater Himalayan Sequence from the overlying Tethyan Himalayan Sequence in the north. Along the Dhauliganga Valley, NW Himalaya, folded psammitic gneisses in the immediate footwall of the STDS yield a Neoproterozoic ~ 1075 Ma U–Pb detrital zircon population and are intruded by Cambro-Ordovician granitoids. This is followed by protracted magmatism during the Late Eocene–Middle Miocene. In addition to structural analysis and deformation fabric studies, the timing of activity along the South Tibetan Detachment System can be constrained by U–Pb zircon geochronology ages of pre-, syn- and post-tectonically deformed and undeformed leucogranite bodies. The concordant leucogranites inherit the Neoproterozoic zircons from the footwall high-grade gneisses during their partial melting. Late Eocene migmatization and melt intrusion (~38–34 Ma) were coeval with Barrovian metamorphic, followed by Late Oligocene extension-induced exhumation. The U–Pb zircon geochronology of leucogranites within the uppermost Greater Himalayan Sequence show Late Eocene–Early Oligocene (35–23 Ma) magmatism. Evidence of Late Eocene (35.3 ± 1.8 Ma) SW-directed contraction, crustal thickening and associated metamorphism is observed in gneisses exhibiting tight isoclinal folds with NE-dipping axial surfaces. The transition from contractional to extensional tectonics might have likely occurred in the Late Oligocene–Early Miocene (24–21 Ma), followed by extension-induced exhumation. Leucogranite emplacement ceased along the South Tibetan Detachment System during the Middle Miocene (17.77 ± 0.61 Ma) and tectonic activity subsequently migrated southwards."

    "title": "Spatial evolution and driving factors of surface water chemistry in the Duliujiang River Basin, Southwest China",
    "abstract": "It is crucial to grasp the spatial evolution characteristics of water chemistry and to quantify the contribution rate of different factors for the precision management and secure utilization of water resources in the basin. In this study, river water samples were systematically collected from the Duliujiang River Basin, the concentrations of anions and cations were measured, and the spatial evolution characteristics and ion sources of the watershed were studied by using hydrochemical diagrams, multivariate mathematical statistics, and the absolute factor analysis–multiple linear regression receptor model (APCS-MLR), and the contribution rate of different sources to the hydrochemical components of the basin was quantified. The results indicate generally weakly alkaline water throughout the Duliujiang River Basin. While hydrochemical types exhibit spatial variability, the Ca–HCO 3 type predominates. The chemical composition of river water in the Duliujiang River Basin is governed by rock weathering, cation alternating adsorption, mineral dissolution/precipitation, and anthropogenic influences, and the APCS-MLR model results show that mining wastewater discharge, rock and mineral dissolution, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and unidentified sources (inferred as groundwater recharge) are the main sources of river solutes. The contribution rates of municipal factors, mining factors, agricultural factors, geological factors, and unidentified factors to the river water were 16%, 28%, 19%, 23%, and 14%, respectively, while the total contribution rate of anthropogenic factors (including municipal factors, mining factors, and agricultural factors) exceeded that of natural factors, reaching 58%, and have become the principal driving factors of hydrochemical evolution in the Duliujiang River Basin."

    "title": "Sources and transportation of mining metals to soil: A case study from the Lala mining area, Southwest China",
    "abstract": "Soil contamination with toxic metals from mining activities poses a risk to ecological security and human well-being, but research on their transport mechanisms is inadequate. Addressing this, this study combines the PCA-APCS-MLR model, hydrological and soil profile analyses, and geographic detector techniques within the Lala mining area, Sichuan Province, China, to explore the connection between soil metal enrichment and mining activities and to assess soil contamination. We identified three primary sources of metals in soils: geogenic background, mining activities, and industrial emissions. Mining activities are the primary source for Mn (13.6%), Cu (33.9%), Mo (69.1%), and As (40.0%) in soil, while industrial inputs contribute to Pb (63.8%), Zn (67.4%), and Cd (83.6%). Meanwhile, dry and wet deposition drove the dispersal mode of mine metals to the soil in the study area. Specifically, coarse mine wastes primarily settle around the mine sites, whereas fine particulates are carried northward by prevailing southwest winds, leading to northward and long-range transport. Our findings are important for assessing the mining industry’s footprint in arid environments."

    "title": "Petrogenesis and tectonic implications of the Jiudaowan Pluton in Jinning, western margin of the Yangtze Block: Evidence from geochemistry and U–Pb geochronology",
    "abstract": "The western margin of the Yangtze Block hosts diverse Neoproterozoic igneous rocks, with exposed S-type granites serving as key indicators for deciphering regional geological evolution. This study focuses on the Jiudaowan granite pluton, located on the western margin of the Yangtze Block, through systematic petrographic, whole-rock geochemical, zircon and monazite U–Pb geochronology, and whole-rock Nd isotopic analyses aiming to elucidate its petrogenesis and tectonic significance. The Jiudaowan granite pluton is a composite body, consisting of the Luotaijiu, Jiudaowan, and Daheishan units, characterized by biotite monzogranites, muscovite–plagioclase granites, and two-mica monzogranites, respectively. LA-ICP-MS zircon and monazite U–Pb dating reveals crystallization ages between 832 and 798 Ma. The three units are peraluminous, containing minerals such as muscovite, garnet, and tourmaline, and exhibiting high SiO 2 (72.99–77.83 wt%), Al 2 O 3 (12.36–15.02 wt%), and A/CNK values (1.06–1.43), confirming their classification as peraluminous S-type granites. Compositional variations within the Jiudaowan granite pluton are primarily controlled by protolith composition and melting mechanisms. The pluton is distinguished by low CaO/Na 2 O ratios (0.02–0.18), high Rb/Sr (0.83–113) and Rb/Ba (0.33–15.2) ratios, and negative ε Nd ( t ) values (−13.6 to −9.1), indicating derivation from partial melting of heterogeneous metasedimentary sources. MgO, TiO 2 , Rb/Sr, and whole-rock Zr saturation temperatures suggest that the Luotaijiu and Daheishan units formed via biotite dehydration melting, whereas the Jiudaowan unit resulted from muscovite dehydration melting. Additionally, the Jiudaowan granite pluton displays a clear negative correlation between Al 2 O 3 , CaO, Fe 2 O 3 T, MgO, TiO 2 , and SiO 2 , along with pronounced Eu negative anomalies and depletions in Sr and Ti, suggesting fractional crystallization of feldspar, mica, and Fe-Ti oxides during magma emplacement. Similarly, variable incompatible element ratios of Nb/U (1.07–18.97) and Nb/La (0.24–26.88) further indicate minor crustal assimilation and contamination during magma evolution. Integrating regional geological data, we propose that the Jiudaowan pluton formed during crustal thickening associated with post-collisional extension, likely related to the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent."

    "title": "Sources and environmental risks of cadmium in soils affected by high geochemical background and artisanal zinc smelting activities",
    "abstract": "Soil cadmium (Cd) pollution is a global environmental issue of significant concern. In southwestern China, soil Cd content is notably influenced by high geochemical background and mining/smelting activities. However, the specific contributions of these Cd sources to Cd enrichment and environmental risks in soils remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigated the total and bioavailable Cd and other metals in the topsoil and subsoils surrounding Caohai Lake in northwestern Guizhou Province. This research aimed to identify Cd sources, assess pollution characteristics, and evaluate the potential environmental risks. The results revealed that the carbonate bedrock has average Cd content of 0.66 mg/kg, confirming a naturally high geochemical background of Cd in the study area. Soil Cd content ranged from 0.14 to 6.69 mg/kg, with topsoil exhibiting higher average Cd content (2.29 mg/kg) than subsoil (0.71 mg/kg). Statistical analyses indicated that Cd in subsoil is primarily of geogenic origin. In contrast, approximately 87% of the total Cd in topsoil originates from atmospheric deposition linked to historical artisanal zinc smelting activities. The study found that Cd in topsoil reaches a moderate pollution level and poses a high potential ecological risk. Furthermore, the proportion of bioavailable Cd (DTPA-extractable) was significantly higher in topsoil (26%) than in subsoil (13%). This elevated Cd bioavailability in topsoil is attributed to atmospheric Cd deposition, lower soil pH, and higher organic matter content. These findings provide critical insights for managing Cd risks in soils from regions with high geochemical backgrounds and smelting activities."

    "title": "The application of carbon isotope compositions of fluorene and its methylated homologues in the sources and depositional environments of sedimentary organic matter",
    "abstract": "Analysis of the carbon isotope composition ( δ 13 C) of individual polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in sedimentary organic matter (OM) and oils is increasingly important in organic geochemistry, as it provides information on OM sources, thermal maturity, and secondary alteration. In this study, the δ 13 C values of fluorene (Flu) and its methylated homologues were investigated in coal extracts and crude oils from various depositional environments (lacustrine shale, marine shale, marine carbonate, and terrestrial coal). The results show that the δ 13 C values of Flu and 1-methylfluorene (1-MF) are primarily affected by the origin of OM and are less related to thermal maturity, which indicates a variety of depositional environments. Two cross-plots of the δ 13 C values for Flu and 1-MF versus the pristane/phytane ratio (Pr/Ph) are used to investigate the effects of the depositional environments and sources of OM. These cross-plots classify the study samples into five environmental/source zones: marine, algae; lacustrine, algae-bacterial mixed; deltaic/lacustrine/coastal, mixed and aquatic-dominated; transitional (marine and terrestrial), mixed and terrigenous-dominated; and coal, terrigenous. The samples from the various depositional environments and sources are distinguishable, particularly those of marine and transitional facies with similar paleoenvironments. The results provide useful tools to discriminate between OM derived from different sources with different levels of marine and terrestrial input."

    "abstract": "In this study, copper extraction from low-grade oxide-sulfide ores was investigated using a leaching method combined with response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize operational conditions and assess leaching kinetics. Given copper’s extensive industrial applications, sustainable recovery from low-grade ores is critical. Five key parameters-acid concentration, leaching time, particle size, temperature, and solids percentage-were identified as major influences on copper recovery. The results revealed that leaching time and solids percentage, along with interactions between temperature-time and temperature-solids percentage, had the most significant effects. Optimal conditions for 80% copper recovery while minimizing iron recovery below 3% included an acid concentration of 1.21 mol \\(\\text {L}^{-1}\\) , a leaching time of 108 min, a particle size of 438 \\(\\upmu\\) m, a temperature of 45 \\(^{\\circ }\\text {C}\\) , and a solids percentage of 18.2%. Leaching kinetics were analyzed using shrinking core models, with the Dickinson model best describing the process, showing an activation energy of 32.63 kJ \\(\\text {mol}^{-1}\\) , indicative of mixed diffusion and chemical reaction control. The final kinetic model effectively predicted the influence of key parameters. These findings highlight the importance of optimizing process variables and selecting suitable kinetic models to enhance extraction efficiency, reduce costs, and improve sustainability in copper recovery."

    "title": "Differential enrichment mechanisms of organic matter in middle-upper Triassic lacustrine mudstone, north Kuqa depression (Tarim Basin, China): An integrated approach utilizing inorganic and organic geochemical evidence",
    "abstract": "The Kuqa Depression, recognized as one of the best hydrocarbon-enriched depressions within the Tarim Basin, has long been debated regarding its principal source intervals, which has restricted petroleum exploration and development in this area. This study focuses on the hydrocarbon source rocks of the Middle-Upper Triassic Karamayi Formation and Upper Triassic Huangshanjie Formation in the northern part of the Kuqa Depression through a comprehensive organic and elemental investigation. The examinations indicate that the source rocks of the Karamayi Formation-Huangshanjie Formation are dark mudstones developed in a lacustrine setting. The organic matter abundance generally ranges from fair to good. The organic matter type is mainly Type II, with a portion being Type III, and the source rocks have reached a mature stage. During the depositional period of the source rocks in the Karamayi Formation, variations in paleoproductivity, characteristics of ancient water bodies and intensity of hydrothermal activity together influenced the organic matter enrichment model of the Misbrac section, which is controlled by preservation conditions and paleoproductivity. In contrast, the Heiyingshan and Kuqa River sections exhibit paleoproductivity-dominated enrichment mechanisms. During the depositional period of the Huangshanjie Formation, the organic matter enrichment model in the study area is controlled by both the preservation conditions and paleoproductivity."

    "title": "Titanium partitioning between pyroxenes and lunar basaltic melts: An experimental perspective",
    "abstract": "The size of basalt fragments in Chang’E-5 (CE-5) regolith are small (< 6 mm 2 ), resulting in large variation on the estimated bulk composition of CE-5 basalt. For example, the estimated TiO 2 content of CE-5 basalt ranges from 3.7 wt% to 12.7 wt% and the Mg# (molar percentage of Mg/[Mg + Fe]) also shows a wide range (26.2 − 42.4). Preliminary experimental studies have shown that these geochemical characteristics of CE-5 basalt are critical for investigating the crystallization sequence and formation mechanism of its parent magma. This study presents new experimental data on the distribution coefficient of titanium between pyroxene and lunar basaltic magma \\(\\left( {{\\text{D}}_{{{\\text{Ti}}}}^{{\\text{Px/melt}}} } \\right)\\) . Combining with available literature data, we confirm that \\({\\text{D}}_{{{\\text{Ti}}}}^{{\\text{Px/melt}}}\\) is affected by crystallization conditions such as pressure and temperature, but it is mainly controlled by the CaO content of pyroxene. Comparing with previous experimental results under similar conditions, we parameterized the effect as \\({\\text{D}}_{{{\\text{Ti}}}}^{{\\text{Px/Melt}}} {\\text{ = D}}_{{{\\text{Ti}}}}^{{\\text{Px/Melt}}} { \\;= - 0}{\\text{.0005X}}_{{{\\text{Cao}}}}^{{2}} { \\;+\\; 0}{\\text{.0218X}}_{{{\\text{CaO}}}} { \\;+\\; 0}{\\text{.0425} ({\\text{R}}^{2} = 0}{.82)}\\) \\(\\text{,}\\) where X CaO is the CaO content in pyroxene in weight percentage. The new experimental results suggest that pyroxene with high TiO 2 content (> 2.5 wt%) in CE-5 basalt is not a product of equilibrium crystallization, and the CaO content in pyroxene is also affected by cooling rate of its parent magma. The TiO 2 content in the CE-5 parent magma is estimated to be about 5 wt% based on the Mg# of pyroxene and its calculated CaO content, which is consistent with those estimated from olivine grains."

    "title": "Initial opening of the southern Paleo-Asian Ocean: evidence from Neoproterozoic magmatism in the Beishan area, southern central Asia orogenic belt, NW China",
    "abstract": "The Beishan area (BA), located along the southern margin of the Central Asian orogenic belt, represents a key region for studying the opening of the southern Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO) during the Neoproterozoic Era. Current understanding of BA’s Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution remains limited because of insufficient constraints. This study presents petrological, whole-rock geochemical, Sr–Nd isotopic, zircon U–Pb dating, and Hf isotopic analyses of gabbro (765 Ma), dacitic tuff (756 Ma), syenogranite (764 Ma), and monzogranite (770 Ma) from the BA. The gabbros show high MgO (8.06–8.31 wt%) and low K 2 O (0.23–1.09 wt%) contents, depletion of high-field-strength elements (Nb, Ta, and Ti), ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i ratios of 0.7051–0.7057, and positive ε Nd (t) values (+ 2.55 to + 3.19). These geochemical signatures suggest derivation from a depleted mantle metasomatized by subducted slab-derived melts, consistent with formation in a back-arc rift setting. The dacitic tuffs display negative ε Nd (t) values (− 16.38 to − 1.29) and Zr-Hf enrichment, indicating an origin from ancient crustal melting. The syenogranites and monzogranites are characterized by high 10,000 Ga/Al and (Zr+Nb+Ce+Y) values, classifying them as A1-type granites. They yield negative ε Nd (t) values (− 6.66 to − 2.29) and variable ε Hf( t) values (− 3.7 to + 4.8), indicating partial melting of Paleoproterozoic crust material. Based on these findings and previous studies, we propose that the initial opening of the southern PAO in the BA occurred no earlier than 770 Ma, likely driven by combined subducted slab rollback and mantle plume upwelling."

    "title": "Petrogenesis and geodynamic setting of the Wutang granites in the Tong’an-Baishuidong lithium mining district, South China: Evidence from monazite U–Pb chronology, geochemistry, and Nd–Pb isotope",
    "abstract": "The Tong’an-Baishuidong mining district (TBMD), located in the eastern section of the Jiangnan Orogen, is a newly discovered granite-type lithium mining district. Thisstudy presents new monazite U–Pb chronological, whole-rock geochemical, and Nd–Pb isotopic data to reveal the petrogenesis and geodynamic setting of the Wutang granites in the TBMD. The monazite U–Pb age of 145.8 ± 1.0 Ma indicates that the granites were emplaced at the end of the Late Jurassic. Whole-rock geochemical results demonstrate that the Wutang granites are enriched in SiO 2 (72.80–73.40 wt%) but depleted in CaO (0.44–0.90 wt%) and MgO+TiO 2 +TFeO (1.79–2.05 wt%). These granites exhibit negative Eu anomalies ( δ Eu = 0.3−0.4) and high aluminum saturation indexes (A/CNK = 1.2−1.6), differentiation indexes (DI = 90–92), and Rb/Sr ratios (4.7–8.1). They also have moderate Ba contents (239–278 ppm) and low Sr contents (52.7–82.0 ppm) as well as low Nb/Ta (2.2–5.3) and Zr/Hf (21.3–31.5) ratios. All these indicate that they are highly fractionated granites. Additionally, these granites contain 5–10 wt% muscovite but no hornblende, with calculated corundum contents of 2.3–5.5 wt%. They have low high-field strength element (HFSE) contents (Zr + Nb + Ce + Y = 182–202 ppm) and zircon saturation temperatures (700–770 °C), with Th and Y negatively linked with Rb. These petrographic and geochemical features further reveal that the Wutang granites belong to highly fractionated S-type granites. The ε Nd (t) values of these granites range from −9.03 to −8.23, corresponding to two-stage model ages (T DM2 ) of 1488–1553 Ma. The initial Pb isotope ratios are: ( 206 Pb/ 204 Pb) i = 18.38–18.55, ( 207 Pb/ 204 Pb) i = 15.67–15.68, and ( 208 Pb/ 204 Pb) i = 38.62–38.67. These Nd–Pb isotopic results demonstrate that the parental magma originated from the partial melting of ancient crustal materials. In the meantime, the TBMD in the eastern section of the Jiangnan Orogen was in a compression-extension transitional setting associated with the episodic subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate."

    "abstract": "Numerous Indosinian igneous rocks in the North Qaidam (NQ) provide crucial insights into the tectonic evolution of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the petrography, mineralogy, geochemistry, zircon U–Pb geochronology, and Hf isotope composition of dioritic rocks from the eastern NQ. Zircon U–Pb dating results indicate that the dioritic rocks were formed during the Middle Triassic (244–240 Ma). The rocks exhibit high-K calc-alkaline characteristics with variable SiO 2 (55.25–65.39 wt%) and elevated K 2 O + Na 2 O (4.81–6.94 wt%) contents. They show enrichment in LILEs (Rb, Ba, K) and depletion in HFSEs (Nb, Ta, Ti), with slight negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.89–0.97). Zircon ε Hf (t) values (−20.93 to + 5.60) and T DM2 ages (0.85–1.72 Ga) suggest mixed sources. Petrographic and mineralogical analysis reveals that the plagioclase phenocrysts exhibit disequilibrium textures (including reverse zoning), primarily composed of andesine and labradorite, with a small amount of oligoclase. The clinopyroxenes are all augites and have high crystallization temperatures (1111–1151 °C). These features, particularly the reverse zoning of plagioclase, support a petrogenetic model involving mantle-derived magma underplating that induced melting of ancient lower crust, followed by mixing of underplated basaltic magma with crust-derived felsic magma. Our results indicate formation in a back-arc extensional setting during subduction of the Zongwulong Paleo-Tethys Ocean."

    "title": "Mineralogy, geochemistry, and stable isotopes in the reconstruction of the paleodepositional environment, provenance, and paleoclimate of Cretaceous mudstones, Koum Basin, Cameroon",
    "abstract": "The Cretaceous Koum Basin is a rift-related half-graben in northern Cameroon, which constitutes a portion of the Yola Arm of the Upper Benue Trough. This study presents the first comprehensive dataset combining mineralogical, bulk-rock geochemical, and stable C–H–O isotopic data for dark-gray, fine-grained mudstones from the basin, providing new insights into its sediment source, paleoenvironment, and geodynamic setting. The mudstones primarily consist of phyllosilicates (~ 8.6%), feldspars (~ 30.5%), carbonates (~ 13.7%), and minor iron oxides (~ 2.7%), with vermiculite, illite, and kaolinite as the main clay minerals. The presence of analcime, ankerite, and dolomite suggests low-grade metamorphism and/or hydrothermal alteration. Fe 2 O 3 /K 2 O (1.52–6.40) and SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (2.97–4.68) ratios classify the mudstones as compositionally immature shales (ICV ~ 1.64) with low-moderate chemical weathering (CIA ~ 56.35; PIA ~ 59.74; R 3+ /R 3+ + R 2+ + M + ~ 0.51). Trace element ratios (Th/Sc ~ 1.70, Zr/Sc ~ 1.33, La/Sc ~ 6.30, La/Th ~ 4.14) indicate an intermediate igneous provenance from a continental crustal source. Paleoenvironmental proxies suggest deposition in a dynamic basin environment marked by fluctuating redox (C org /P: 0.21–178.34) and salinity (Sr/Ba: 0.34–3.25; N-values: 48–35.92) conditions, ranging from oxic to anoxic and brackish to saline. Major element data (SiO 2 vs. Al 2 O 3 + K 2 O + Na 2 O) indicate a semi-arid regime, while Paleoclimatic indicators such as Sr/Cu (1.88–37.47) and C-values (0.12–0.93) suggests alternating humid and arid conditions. Notably, stable isotope data, reported here for the first time in the Koum Basin, reveal a predominantly terrestrial, fluvial-deltaic C 3 plant source for organic carbon ( δ 13 C − 25.2‰ to − 35.2‰) and complex fluid-rock interactions involving meteoric and magmatic-metamorphic fluids under a warm, equatorial climate ( δ 18 O + 3.6‰ to + 24.9‰, δ 2 H − 104‰ to − 50‰). The combined mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic data point to deposition in a tectonically active continental arc setting, with contributions from ocean island arc and passive margin sources."

    "title": "The zoning rule and forming mechanism of tectonite-mineralized alteration lithofacies of black/fracture zone of the Daliangzi Pb–Zn deposit in southwest Sichuan in China",
    "abstract": "As one of the typical deposits in the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Pb–Zn metallogenic province, the Daliangzi Pb–Zn deposit has a close genetic relationship with the structural system of the black/fracture zone formed under the action of the NWW-approximately EW strike-slip structures in the metallogenic province. The R1 black/fracture zone has a close relationship with ore forming; however, the mechanism of the rock- and ore-controlling action of the structural system remains unclear. Based on a detailed analysis of the tectonite-mineralized alteration lithofacies of the R1 black/fracture zone, the tectonite-mineralized alteration lithofacies zones can be divided into four types in succession outward from the Pb–Zn mineralization center (F 5 , F 100 , and other faults), i.e., (1) the brecciated and stockwork-like Pb–Zn mineralization-complex breccia facies zone; (2) the stockwork-like Pb–Zn mineralization-simple breccia and cataclasite facies zone; (3) the veined pyrite–sulfide–dolomitic cataclasite facies zone; (4) the fine-veined calcite-black carbonized dolomite facies zone. With the evolution of the ore-forming fluid, the homogenization temperature decreases from Zone 1 to Zone 4; the salinity increases from Zone 1 to Zone 2 and then it decreases from Zones 3 and 4. The fluid density shows little change overall. The contents of Zn, Pb, Cu, Ga, Ge, Cd, Ag, and other metallogenic elements, Zn/Pb ratio, and CaO/MgO mole ratio decrease gradually from Zone 1 to Zone 4, and the REE fractionation, calcilization, silicification, and pyritization enhance gradually from Zone 1 to Zone 4. This series of changes is the product of diapirism (cryptoexplosion) of strike-slip structures and the black/fracture zone, among which the second-order structures derived from NWW-approximately EW-striking dextral shear-tension faults F 1 and F 15 control the brecciated and stockwork-like Pb–Zn mineralized complex breccia facies zones and the stockwork-like Pb–Zn mineralized simple breccia and cataclasite facies zones. Therefore, this paper establishes the zoning mode of tectonite-mineralized alteration lithofacies of the black/fracture zone and proposes that Zones 1 and 2 provide important prospecting criteria."

    "title": "Deep geological processes of the early Middle Jurassic granitic complexes in the Songjianghe area, Jiapigou-Haigou collage zone, Northeast China: Evidence from zircon U–Pb dating, elemental geochemistry and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopes",
    "abstract": "The deep geologic processes between the Xing’an-Mongolian Orogenic Belt and the North China Craton in the Mesozoic are crucial to reveal the magmatic and tectonic evolution and their constraints on mineralization in the Jiapigou-Haigou collage zone. In this paper, We have presented the geochronology, geochemistry and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic compositions of the Middle Jurassic granitic complexes in the Songjianghe area, Jilin Province. The granitic complexes can be categorized into four groups based on their geologic characteristics, with corresponding zircon U–Pb isotope ages of 177 Ma, 172 Ma, 169 Ma and 168–167 Ma, respectively. These granitoids exhibit calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline, metaluminous to weakly peraluminous I-type characteristics, which show relative enrichment in LILEs (Rb, Sr, Ba) and depletion in HFSEs (Nb, Zr). Geochemical analyses reveal high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of 0.70633–0.70740, coupled with low εNd(t) values ranging from −10.65 to −13.23. The zircon analyses show similarly negative εHf(t) values ranging from −16.9 to −3.2. The integrated elemental and Hf–Sr–Nd isotopic signatures demonstrate that the primitive magmas of the four group rocks were primarily derived from partial melting of thickened Archean lower crust, with the exception of the Group IV rocks, which exhibit significant evidence of crustal contamination. The residual mineral assemblages during the magma-forming process varied from amphibole to eclogite facies. These findings indicate that magmatism in the Songjianghe region likely resulted from the accretion and delamination of the Archean crust in the collage zone during the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate beneath the Eurasian continent."

    "title": "Impact of bicarbonate on organic acid exudation, silicon uptake and utilization in maize roots",
    "abstract": "Global climate change has made carbon neutrality a crucial goal. The karst environment, with high bicarbonate content, challenges plant growth and carbon sequestration. Bicarbonate has both negative and positive effects on plants, and selecting suitable crops to effectively leverage the positive effects of bicarbonates is vital for karst agriculture. This study aimed to investigate how different bicarbonate concentrations affect organic acid exudation from maize roots. It also explored the impact on silicon uptake, growth, photosynthesis and cellular metabolic energy in two maize varieties (Jingke 968 and Tiannuo 182) and compared their adaptability to bicarbonate environments. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse. Maize seedlings were cultured with Hoagland’s nutrient solution containing different concentrations of NaHCO 3 (0, 5 and 10 mM). After 21 days, various indices were measured. The results show that malic and citric acids were key organic acids in maize’s response to bicarbonate stress. Jingke 968, under bicarbonate stress, exhibits reduced photosynthesis and growth, with less energy for silicon uptake and lower carbon storage in phytoliths. Tiannuo 182 adapts better to a 5 mM bicarbonate environment. It also exudes more organic acids, improving its adaptation to high bicarbonate (10 mM) conditions and enhancing carbon sequestration. Tiannuo 182 is more suitable for karst regions with complex bicarbonate environments as it can allocate more energy to growth and silicon absorption. The differential response of maize varieties to bicarbonate stress provides scientific support for variety selection and zoning in karst cultivation areas."

    "title": "Determinants of high gas content and restoration of in situ gas content in Permian Wujiaping shale of the eastern Sichuan Basin, China",
    "abstract": "The Permian Wujiaping Formation (P 3 w ) shale in eastern Sichuan Basin exhibits high gas content. Through total organic carbon (TOC) content determination, mineral composition analysis, N 2 /CO 2 adsorption, high-pressure methane adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy experiments, we identified determinants of the high gas content and restored in-situ gas content. Findings demonstrate that the supercritical Dubinin–Astakhov (S-DA) model (based on micropore-filling theory) represents the optimal approach for accurately restoring the absolute adsorption amount of the third member of P 3 w (P 3 w 3 ) shale within the study region compared to the supercritical Langmuir (S-L) model (based on monolayer adsorption theory) widely used in the assessment of gas content of the Wufeng–Longmaxi shale. The P 3 w 3 and Wufeng–Longmaxi shales have similar adsorption capacities at equivalent TOC levels, with the high adsorbed gas content of P 3 w 3 attributed to the development of rich organic shale (with a TOC content of 7.68%) in the anoxic reduction environment of the deep marine shelf facies. The high free gas content is due to the abundant siliceous minerals that play an anti-compaction and pore-preservation effect during the diagenesis, forming rich pore spaces (porosity of 6.05%). Under the influence of formation temperature and pressure, the in-situ gas content of P 3 w 3 shale reservoir gradually increases with burial depth. The P 3 w 3 shale gas reservoir with a burial depth of 4300–4400 m mainly exists in the free state, with the ratio of free gas to adsorbed gas approximately 7:3."

    "title": "Genesis of the Heima zinnwaldite deposit in the Gongshan region, Southeast Tibetan plateau",
    "abstract": "The middle-scale Heima zinnwaldite deposit is situated in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, SW China. The NNW- to NS-trending orebodies are hosted in the Gaoligongshan metamorphic zone. To clarify the zinnwaldite genesis at Heima, this study presents an integrated investigation of the Heima pegmatites, combining precise geochronology, isotopic tracing, and detailed mineral chemistry to constrain its formation age, petrogenetic origin, and mineralization processes. Our robust geochronological framework, employing magmatic zircon (56.93 ± 0.53 Ma) and cassiterite (57.0 ± 4.2 Ma), establishes the pegmatite emplacement during the Late Paleocene to Early Eocene, representing the maximum age of lithium mineralization. Hf isotopic compositions ( ε Hf (t) = −14.3 to −12.4) demonstrate that the Heima pegmatite originated from remelting of ancient sediments, distinguishing it from contemporaneous Eocene Gangdese–Tengchong granites ( ε Hf (t) = −12.7 to +11.0) that show mantle contributions. This crustal signature aligns with the evolutionary trend of Hf isotopes in regional gneissic granites (600−420 Ma), supporting an anatectic origin from ancient continental crust rather than being derivatives of nearby Eocene granitic plutons. Detailed geochemical analysis of Li-micas reveals two distinct generations with contrasting formation mechanisms. The primary mica-Ia (53.45 ± 0.86 Ma, Rb–Sr age) exhibits extreme incompatible element enrichment (Li, Be, Rb, Cs) and remarkably low K/Rb ratios (3.98–4.37), characteristic of crystallization from highly fractionated granitic melts. In contrast, secondary mica-Ib and mica-II (17.9–16.0 Ma, Rb–Sr age) show significant Nb–Ta–W enrichment, reflecting precipitation from F–P-rich hydrothermal fluids during Miocene metamorphic–hydrothermal events. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirms the compositional disparity between these mica generations, with the later phases attributed to fluid-induced alteration and reworking. Regional correlation identifies two distinct lithium mineralization episodes in the Gongshan area, southeast Tibetan Plateau. The Eocene phase (~ 55 Ma) is zinnwaldite-dominant (e.g., Heima, Puladi), associated with crustal melting following Neo-Tethyan closure. The Miocene phase (~ 17 Ma) is spodumene-dominant (e.g., Danzhu, Peili), linked to Himalayan leucogranites formed as the rapid exhumation, denudation, and decompression partial melting of Himalayan Crystalline Complex."

    "title": "Fluid migration in calcite nanopores under salinity gradients: Insights from molecular dynamics",
    "abstract": "The migration mechanisms of ore-forming fluids have long been a focus in the field of ore deposit studies. Calcite is ubiquitously present in various types of rocks in the lithosphere, and the underlying mechanisms of its influence on fluid migration are of crucial importance. While previous studies have revealed that salinity changes can modulate fluid migration, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We employ molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate how salinity variations in ore-forming fluids modulate the adsorption onto calcite nanopore walls, thereby revealing the microscopic mechanisms governing ore fluid transport through calcite nano-fractures. The results show that the adsorption energy E int of the solution on the calcite surface increased from −14,948.84 ± 182.48 kcal/mol to −12,144.08 ± 118.2 kcal/mol as salinity increased, which is conducive to the long-range transport of the fluid in the calcite nanopore."

    "title": "Optimal delineation of iron ore-finding target areas in the Beishan Region, Gansu Province, China, based on multi-source data mining technology",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of geological prospecting depends on the accuracy of prediction of target areas. Compared to traditional qualitative methods, the application of big data concepts and methods to conduct in-depth analyses of the potential value of geological information has proven to be an effective way to improve the accuracy of prospecting target area predictions. The Beishan region of Gansu Province, China, is a prominent polymetallic metallogenic belt in northwest China. In recent years, geologists have encountered challenges in achieving effective breakthroughs in prospecting through conventional methods. In this study, we employ the concepts and methodologies of big data. The research subject encompasses the geochemical and aeromagnetic data from the Beishan region of Gansu Province, where a suite of proprietary software is employed to rectify errors in the initial data set. On this basis, an iron ore prospecting model based on multi-source data information mining has been established. The model has delineated 100 Level I and II preferred target areas with mineral prospecting significance and has constrained these areas to 3.24% of the study area. Following field sampling and verification, the actual mineralization rate of the 38 Level I target areas was determined to be 50%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper in improving the prediction accuracy of iron ore target areas."

    "title": "Prolonged mantle metasomatism in the Neoproterozoic continental arc: Insights from mafic magmatism in the western Yangtze Block, South China",
    "abstract": "Mafic rocks generated from subduction settings have recorded valuable source information about the mantle source. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of zircon U–Pb dating, whole-rock major and trace elements, and Sr–Nd isotopic data for the mafic gabbro located in the Yumen area, on the western part of the Yangtze Block, South China, aiming to constrain the processes of mantle metasomatism within subduction settings. U–Pb dating results for zircon yield crystallization ages of 800 Ma for type 1 mafic gabbro and 753–734 Ma for type 2 mafic gabbro. Type 1 mafic gabbro exhibits higher SiO 2 (44.13%–48.93%) and Al 2 O 3 content but lower total Fe 2 O 3 and MgO content than type 2 gabbro (SiO 2 : 41.02%–43.28%). These gabbros display a high-Mg # signature (52.50–62.81 for type 1, 50.89–57.04 for type 2), while they are enriched in significant large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs: Rb, Ba, Sr, K) and depleted in high-field-strength elements (HFSEs: Zr, Hf, Nd, Ta, Ti), which indicates an arc-like element signature. The positive whole-rock εNd(t) values (type 1: 3.5–4.4, type 2: 5.6–6.3) combined with a narrow range of ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i (type 1: 0.7035–0.7043, type 2: 0.7035–0.7036) of both gabbro types suggest a depleted lithospheric mantle origin. Therefore, these mafic rocks may derive from a metasomatized spinel lherzolite mantle source (with amphibole) due to the interactions of the deep mantle source and subduction fluid materials. We propose that the long-term metasomatism recorded by mafic gabbro in this study supports the fact that the subduction during the Neoproterozoic contributed to the formation of a metasomatized mantle source in the Yumen area, western Yangtze Block, South China."

    "title": "Field and geochemical characteristics of the southwestern part of Sendra Ambaji Granitoid Belt, Rajasthan, India: Implication on its petro-tectonic evolution",
    "abstract": "Neoproterozoic Sendra Ambaji Granitoid forms a NE–SW trending, ~360-km-long belt of intruding Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Delhi Supergroup along the Phulad Shear Zone in the South Delhi Fold Belt, northwest India. All work previously carried out on this granitoid is concentrated in the northern part of the belt, leading to difficulties in defining its petrogenesis and tectonic setting. To fill these knowledge gaps, a 350-km 2 area has been mapped in the southern extent of the belt between Sayra and Dhanbari. Field characteristics such as contact relationship, structure and geochemical characteristics are considered. Field studies show the presence of multiple cogenetic gneissose and non-gneissose but crudely foliated granitoid variants, which have been mapped separately. Three phases of ductile deformation and two phases of metamorphism in amphibolite facies akin to Phulad Ophiolite Suite are observed in all the granitoid variants. Refolding of gniessosity with the second deformation is observed in the granitoids and the Phulad Ophiolite Suite. Geochemical studies indicate that these granitoids are metaluminous to peraluminous, magnesian to ferroan, high K-alkaline fractionated I-type granitoids. Their composition is governed by partial melting of metasedimentary and mafic rocks of the continental crust at high temperature and subsequent fractionation, which has led to overlapping of S- and A-type granites on the I-type Sendra Ambaji Granitoid. The granitoids plot in both orogenic and post-collisional or within-plate fields. These signatures corroborate the inferences reached during field work, suggesting that Sendra Ambaji Granitoids were emplaced during the waning phases of orogeny in a subduction-related Andean-type continental arc setting. However, the emplacement of the granitoids continued post-orogeny. This collisional event is correlated with the amalgamation of the Rhodinia supercontinent."

    "title": "Heat flow as a catalyst for radiogenic helium release in the East Africa Rift System",
    "abstract": "The Rukwa Rift section of the East Africa Rift System presents a type setting for radiogenic helium accumulation in a petroleum free basin. As a prerequisite for accumulation, a considerable high heat flow anomaly is required from tectonothermal events to drive the release and circulation of radiogenic helium in the continental crust. Here we apply statistical analysis on geochemical data observed in thermal springs and recorded heat flow to account for crustal helium mass balance for each tectonothermal event in the region. Our results demonstrate anomalously high heat flow ~ 64–99 mW/m 2 with a consistent trend of helium isotopic ratio and fluid chemistry in the Rukwa Rift. Mass balance calculation show that the whole crustal volume underlying the East Africa Helium Pool (EAHP) has a capability of producing radiogenic helium of about 9.9 × 10 6 mol/yr (22 × 10 –6 mol 4 He/m 2 yr) while the total radiogenic helium flux ranges between ~2.39 × 10 6 mol/yr and ~2.68 × 10 9 mol/yr. The Tanzania Craton contributes largely to radiogenic helium releasing up to 50% of the total capacity in the region. The total 4 He emission in the Rukwa Rift Basin is about 4.45 × 10 5 –5.01 × 10 8 mol/yr which is thus equivalent to 19%–21% of the total production capacity in the region. These results imply that the helium accumulation in the EAHP would have started as early as Paleoproterozoic (2.349 Ga). These results provide a qualitative and quantitative insight to assess both helium and geothermal potentiality in the region."

    "abstract": "The Cambrian basin of the Tethyan Himalaya lies along the northern margin of the Indian Plate. For the first time to our knowledge, the clastic sediments of the Kunzam La Formation (Cambrian Series 2–Stage 4) in the Tidong Valley, Kinnaur, have been subjected to a geochemical investigation. Analysis of rare earth elements and trace elements, supported by sandstone petrography and modal analysis, indicates a mixed provenance—primarily felsic (UCC composition) with some basic (HFSE-depleted) input—suggesting derivation from continental crustal melts in an active marginal continental island arc setting, linked to recycled orogens. The Cambrian basin was subsequently obliterated by the Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician Kurgiakh Orogeny, accompanied by extensive acidic magmatism and metamorphism. Elemental ratios of Ce/Ce*, Eu/Eu*, Ni/Co, U/Th, Y/Ho, Sr/Ba, and Sr/Cu, suggesting the formation, were deposited in a shallow marine environment with fluvial influence under highly oxidizing palaeo-redox conditions, low palaeo-salinity, and a warm, humid climate. The present geochemical data complement previous sedimentological studies of the formation in the Tidong Valley and enable a comparative assessment with geochemical data from the Spiti region."

    "title": "Pressure dependence of the structures and transport properties of supercritical NaAlSi3O8–H2O fluids",
    "abstract": "Supercritical fluids play a crucial role in material transport within Earth's deep interior. Investigating the pressure-dependent atomic structures and transport properties of such fluids is essential for understanding their petrological, chemical, and geophysical behaviors. In this study, we employed first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to explore the structures, self-diffusion coefficients ( \\(D\\) ), and viscosities ( η ) of supercritical NaAlSi 3 O 8 –H 2 O fluids under conditions of 2000 K and 3–10 GPa, with water contents of 30 wt% and 50 wt%. Our calculations indicate that at a water content of 30 wt%, Q 2 and Q 3 exhibit a certain degree of positive and negative pressure dependence, respectively, while other Q n species (n represents the number of bridging oxygens connected to Si/Al) show minimal changes. At a water content of 50 wt%, Q 2 and Q 0 exhibit a certain degree of positive and negative pressure dependence, respectively, while other Q n species show minimal changes. At both water contents, Si–O–H and molecular water in the system exhibit negative pressure dependence, suggesting that the migration of supercritical fluids from deep to shallow regions is accompanied by the release of water. The self-diffusion coefficients in the supercritical NaAlSi 3 O 8 –H 2 O fluid follow the order \\(D\\) Na ≈ \\(D\\) H > \\(D\\) O > \\(D\\) Al ≈ \\(D\\) Si , with an overall weak negative pressure dependence. By comparing the viscosities of anhydrous and hydrous silicate melts from previous studies, we found that the addition of water caused a transition from negative to positive pressure dependence of viscosity, corresponding to a structural change from polymerization to depolymerization. Additionally, we calculated the fluid mobility Δ ρ / η of supercritical NaAlSi 3 O 8 –H 2 O fluids and found that their mobility is several orders of magnitude higher than that of basalt melt and is also significantly greater than that of carbonate melt. As supercritical fluids ascend from deeper to shallower regions, their mobility is further enhanced, significantly contributing to the transport of elements from subducting slabs to the overlying mantle wedge."

    "title": "Deep carbon cycle from sediments in subduction zones",
    "abstract": "Over 90% of Earth’s carbon is stored in the mantle and core. The deep carbon cycle plays a critical role in regulating surface carbon fluxes, global climate, and the habitability of Earth. Carbon mainly residing within the sediments, altered oceanic crust, and mantle peridotite as carbonate minerals and organic carbon is transported to the deep Earth via plate subduction. A series of reactions (e.g., metamorphism, dissolution, and melting) occurring in the subducting slab drive the carbon removal. Some of the carbon is recycled to the surface via arc volcanism, while the rest is carried into the deeper Earth. More than two-thirds of the global subduction carbon input comes from sedimentary carbon, whose fate during subduction directly affects the flux in the global carbon cycle. Over the past two decades, the sedimentary carbon cycle in subduction zones has been extensively studied by experiments and computational approaches. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the sources, species, decarbonation reactions, carbon cycle tracing, and fluxes of sedimentary carbon in subduction zones, and the role of sedimentary carbon subduction in climate evolution and mantle chemistry. Further research is required for our understanding of deep carbon cycle processes and their role in Earth's climate."

    "title": "Extraction of niobium from the Bayan Obo Fe-REE-Nb deposit: A comprehensive review and new insights",
    "abstract": "With the development of aviation, superconducting, and other steel industries, the demand for niobium (Nb) has significantly increased worldwide, positioning it as a critical strategic metal. The Bayan Obo rare-earth elements (REE)-Nb-iron (Fe) deposit contains over 70% of China’s Nb resources and hosts the world’s largest reserves of REE. However, due to technical and environmental challenges, a substantial portion of the Nb resources remains underutilized and stored in tailings. Research and development of efficient, environmentally friendly, low-energy consumption, and less complex methods for extracting Nb from the Bayan Obo tailings possess significant scientific value and strategic importance. This paper reviews the current research status and distinctive geological and mineralogical characteristics of Nb resources in the Bayan Obo deposit, as well as existing pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical technologies for extracting Nb from ores and tailings, subsequently comparing their advantages to guide the development of new processes. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the technical, economic, environmental, quality, and safety aspects, it is suggested that future research should prioritize establishing a systematic recommendation procedure for targeted Nb-bearing mineral characterization and analysis for the Bayan Obo tailings, developing fluoride-free or low-fluoride hydrometallurgical techniques, and exploring innovative methods for Nb mineral coarsening. This review thus provides new insights into the efficient utilization of the Bayan Obo Nb resources and supports the development of innovative and effective strategies for optimizing Nb extraction from ores and tailings."

    "title": "Arsenopyrite reveals the deuteric origin of the Saxi tungsten deposit, SW China",
    "abstract": "The Saxi tungsten deposit, located in the Laojunshan ore district of southeastern Yunnan Province, is a significant W-polymetallic deposit. The origins of tungsten-bearing pegmatite dikes and quartz vein mineralization in the Saxi deposit remain poorly understood. This study employs in situ U–Pb dating of apatite from the altered granite, along with trace element and S–Pb isotopic analysis of arsenopyrite, to investigate the timing, source of ore-forming fluids and the mechanisms of tungsten enrichment. The apatite in the altered granite yields a U–Pb age of 147.0±4.0 Ma, indicating magmatic activity during the Early Cretaceous. Three generations of arsenopyrite (Apy) are identified: Apy-1 in the altered granite, Apy-2 in the pegmatite dikes and Apy-3 in the quartz veins. The S/Fe ratios for Apy-1, Apy-2 and Apy-3 range from 0.98 to 1.09, 0.89 to 0.92 and 0.86 to 1.02, respectively (average 0.97), suggesting a magmatic-hydrothermal origin. Sulfur isotope values ( δ 34 S = 4.29‰–8.11‰) indicate that it was likely sourced from deep magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. Lead isotopic compositions of arsenopyrite suggest that the granitic parental magma is derived from the upper crust. These findings point to a magmatic-hydrothermal origin for the vein-type tungsten mineralization, linked to a concealed magmatic-hydrothermal system in the Early Cretaceous."

    "title": "Fabrics of forsterite in CBa chondrite Sierra Gorda 013",
    "abstract": "CB chondrite is a class of meteorite rich in metal composition, and its characteristics are obviously different from other chondrite groups. These meteorites are distinguished by their content of up to 60% to 70% FeNi metals and sulfides, in addition to their extreme lack of volatile and moderately volatile elements, less refractory inclusions, and almost no fine-grained matrix. Sierra Gorda 013 (SG 013) is a metal-rich chondritic meteorite of the CBa type. It has two different lithologies within SG 013: Lithology 1 and Lithology 2. Lithology 1 is an anomalous CBa chondrite containing chromite-pyroxene complex assemblage, whereas Lithology 2 is featured by recrystallization with small chondrules and contains much less iron nickel metal than Lithology 1. Although the two lithologies have essentially the same oxygen isotope composition, their structures are different from each other, suggesting that they probably underwent distinct formation and evolution processes from common precursors. In this study, the mineralogy of SG 013 chondrites is studied by means of petrographic observation, semi-quantitative analysis of chemical composition, fabric identification of minerals and integrated mineral phase analysis, while studying the mineralogy of SG 013, and the fabric characteristics of SG 013 are studied in detail. Different from previous studies, here we find that Lithology 1 of SG 013 contains non-porphyritic chondrules and metallic silicate globules, while Lithology 2 not only contains non-porphyritic chondrules and metallic-silicate globules, but also porphyritic chondrules. In this thesis, Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of magnesium olivine in metal-silicate globules and porphyritic chondrules in L2 of SG 013 shows that some magnesium olivine form under conditions of lower temperature and faster strain rate during uniaxial compression, where deformation of the olivine is dominated by dislocation glide. However, at higher temperatures and slower strain rates, the fabric of B-axis ([100]) is concentrated, indicating that the porphyritic chondrules may be dominated by the compaction of olivine particles, leading to dynamic recrystallization in the peripheral region or outer layer of the magnesium olivine crystal. New grains formed by dynamic recrystallization occur at the edges of residual grains and, their orientation is controlled by stress. It is found that the formation position of magnesium olivine in different chondrules of SG 013 from the inside out, with the gradual reduction of stress and the gradual increase of temperature, these local physicochemical changes reveal the complex thermal history and dynamic processes that chondrules undergo during their formation and evolution."

    "title": "Trace element geochemistry of dispersed organic matter in Western Mecsek uranium ore deposit, Southern Hungary",
    "abstract": "This paper provides analytical insights into the geochemical composition, particularly focusing on gold, of dispersed organic matter (DOM) mainly present within vitrinite and solid bitumen. This DOM is closely associated with uranium ores located within the Late Permian Kővágószőlős Sandstone Formation in Western Mecsek, South-West Hungary. The presence of DOM is notable in the uranium-rich formation of the deposit. However, crucial aspects such as its morphological characteristics, trace element composition, and its relationship with ore minerals are still largely unexplored. The study utilizes a range of techniques, including optical microscopic analysis, maceral and vitrinite reflectance analyses; and trace element measurement using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The analytical data show that DOM has six different morphologies: primary vitrinite, secondary (reworked) vitrinite, inertinite, solid bitumen, pyrobitumen, and graphite. Vitrinite reflectance of DOM ranges from 1.7% to 2.9%. The DOM has average content of Au 0.67 ppm, Ag 7.7 ppm, U 58.8 ppm and Th 22 ppm, As 256 ppm, Cu 91 ppm, Ni 61 ppm, and P 259 ppm. We conclude that DOM exhibits elevated levels of gold and uranium, likely attributed to its deposition under reducing conditions. These findings support the potential use of DOM's trace element composition as an indicator of the formation conditions of ore mineralization. Specifically, our data suggest that using LA-ICP-MS to analyze trace elements, within DOM could serve as a valuable exploration tool within the Kővágószőlős Sandstone Formation in the Western Mecsek deposit."

    "abstract": "The Shangdan suture zone preserves critical information about the Paleozoic collision between the North and South Qinling Belts. Although this collision event significantly influenced the tectonic evolution of the Qinling Orogenic Belt, the timing remains a subject of debate. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the Th/U ratios, elongation ratios, and U–Pb ages of detrital zircons to investigate provenance signatures and tectonic-sedimentary settings. Detailed U–Pb dating of detrital zircons from Ordovician to Devonian strata in the Shanyang and Xunyang area of South Qinling Belt revealed age clusters of 430–450, 710–840, and 910–960 Ma for Devonian and Silurian samples, with peaks at ~ 440, ~ 800, and ~ 940 Ma, respectively. Ordovician samples predominantly exhibited ages of 710–850 Ma, peaking at ~ 735 Ma, but lacked the 910–960Ma age group. Comparison with magmatic events in adjacent terranes and detrital zircon mixing provenance modeling identified 430–450 and 910–960 Ma peaks associated with granitoids in the North Qinling Belt, while the 710–840 Ma age population corresponded to sources from the South China Block and South Qinling Belt. Provenance analysis indicated that Devonian and Silurian samples originated from the northern and southern sides of the Shangdan suture zone, whereas Ordovician samples were derived from the southern side. This shift in provenance suggests a significant change in sedimentary sources in the South Qinling Belt from the Ordovician to the Silurian. The closure of the Shangdan Ocean likely occurred during the Silurian-Devonian period, resulting in a northern provenance for the Silurian and Devonian strata."

    "abstract": "The extra-peninsular Gondwana Group rocks are exposed in narrow patches within the Lesser Himalayan sequence of the NE-Arunachal Himalayas, India. The bulk of sediments for the sandstones of the Gondwana Group were derived from felsic/acidic to intermediate igneous rocks, with minor mafic input from the upper continental crust (UCC), as supported by various discrimination diagrams based on quantification of detrital minerals coupled with sandstone geochemistry. The inputs from metamorphic sources in subordinate amounts cannot be ruled out, as indicated by quantification of the quartz varieties. These sediments were found to be sourced from the interior part of a craton or shield and recycled platformal sediments which were derived from both passive and active margin settings. The sediments experienced a wide variance in climatic conditions, from arid to humid, suffering low–moderate-intensity weathering (CIA: 63.43; CIW: 86.18; WIP: 44.84; PIA: 75.37; ICV: 2.39; C -value: 0.42; PF: 0.49; Sr/Cu: 9.23 and Rb/Sr: 1.68) within the vicinity of the low plains to moderate hills. Additionally, redox-sensitive elements indicate the deposition of sediments under oxygenated or oxygen-rich conditions (U au : −2.91; Th/U: 7.37; U/Th: 0.18; V/Cr: 1.71; δU: 0.67 and Ce/Ce*: 0.93)."

    "title": "Environmental impacts of mine tailings and phytoremediation as a sustainable management strategy: A review",
    "abstract": "Mining activities are often associated with significant environmental degradation, particularly due to the accumulation of mine tailings (MTs). These waste materials are frequently stored in dams or open ponds without adequate treatment, posing serious risk of heavy metals (HMs) contamination to surrounding ecosystems. Given these challenges, restoration of MTs to mitigate their negative impacts has become highly important. This study attempts to compile different types of MTs, their characteristics, and associated issues such as acid mine drainage (AMD) and HMs contamination, along with other environmental impacts. It also explores the fundamentals of phytoremediation, highlighting key processes, recent advancements, benefits, limitations, and strategies for post-harvest management. The findings indicate that MTs are a major source of HM pollution and contribute significantly to environmental deterioration. Phytoremediation has emerged as a promising, cost-effective, and eco-friendly solution for MT restoration. In addition to mitigating contamination, phytoremediation enhances soil quality, prevents erosion, reduces HM leaching into groundwater, and improves the visual appeal of degraded sites. Research suggests that revegetating MT-contaminated soils with specific plant species can effectively remediate these areas, reducing HM leaching risks while improving soil properties. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers working on MT restoration, offering insights into the latest advancements in phytoremediation technology and its potential to address the environmental challenges posed by MTs."

    "title": "Neoproterozoic granitoid-hosted quartz-magnetite mega veins at Mayo Binka, western Cameroon: Field disposition and petrochemical characteristics",
    "abstract": "Enigmatic shear zone-related mega quartz-magnetite veins, hosted by Neoproterozoic granitoids of the Central African Fold Belt (CAFB) in Mayo Binka, western Cameroon, are investigated using new field, ore microscopy, bulk-rock geochemistry, and magnetite microchemical datasets to elucidate their origin and deposit type. Magnetite is paragenetically the earliest Fe-oxide phase in the Mayo Binka prospect. Its partial replacement by mechanically twinned specular hematite and martite, along with ilmenite exsolution textures, indicates hydrothermal processes. The magnetite ores are characterized by high Fe 2 O 3 (~81 wt%) and low SiO 2 (~15.7 wt%), Al 2 O 3 (~0.48 wt%), TiO 2 (~0.01 wt%), and P 2 O 5 (~0.03 wt%) contents. The rare earth element (REE) signature, marked by low ΣREE content (~12.62 ppm), enrichment in LREE (La/Yb CN ~4.16) over HREE (Gd/Yb CN ~1.48), a slight negative Eu anomaly (~0.97), and a strong negative La anomaly (~0.52), suggests elevated-temperature, igneous origin for the magnetite deposits rather than sedimentary. Magnetite microchemistry reveals high concentrations of Ti (~16 wt%), V (~3881 ppm), Al (~12,031 ppm), Mn (~3058 ppm), and Ga (~39 ppm), indicating magmatic crystallization under low oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) in contrast to the hydrothermal signatures shown by petrographic observations. Trace element-based discrimination diagrams classify the Mayo Binka prospect as an Fe–Ti–V magmatic magnetite deposit. Field association with granitoids, fault rocks, and metavocanosedimentary rocks (schist, amphibolite, gneiss, and quartzite), coupled with petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical datasets, suggests that the Mayo Binka massive ferriferous veins likely formed in a complex geodynamic continental back-arc setting, where magmatic sedimentary and tectonic processes controlled the localization and evolution of the mineralization."

    "title": "Petrography, geochemistry, and zircon U–Pb chronology of the Late Ordovician metavolcanic suites in the eastern North Qilian orogenic belt, NW China: constraints on their petrogenesis and tectonic implications",
    "abstract": "The study area is situated in the Tianshan region, specifically within the eastern segment of the North Qilian Orogenic Belt (NQLOB). The NQLOB is a critical region for understanding oceanic closure and continental collision processes driven by the Shangdan Ocean subduction-exhumation, which was a segment of the Proto-Tethys Ocean during the Early Paleozoic. Despite significant research, the Early Paleozoic tectonic background and subduction-related orogenic processes, particularly in the eastern NQLOB, remain subjects of debate. This study presents significant petrographic, geochemical, and geochronologic insights into the metavolcanic rocks of the Chenjiahe Group in the eastern NQLOB. Petrographic analysis reveals that these metavolcanic rocks originated in a low-grade metamorphic setting. Zircon laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U–Pb dating yielded ages ranging between 449.7–443.4 Ma, indicating Late Ordovician formation. Geochemical signatures of felsic and intermediate rocks exhibit calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline similarities, characterized by high light rare earth elements (LREEs), low heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), and moderate Eu anomalies, consistent with a continental arc setting. In contrast, basaltic rocks display tholeiitic features with elevated large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs), reduced high-field-strength elements (HFSEs), and weak Eu anomalies, suggesting an extensional environment. These findings imply that the metavolcanic rocks evolved in a continental arc-back-arc extension setting connected with the northward subduction and exhumation of the Huluhe back-arc oceanic basin. This process was likely triggered by the northward subduction and closure of the Shangdan Ocean, culminating in the Late Ordovician amalgamation of the Qilian Block and the southwestern North China Block. This study provides critical insight into the tectonic development of the NQLOB and the broader Proto-Tethys Ocean dynamics at the northern periphery of the Eastern Gondwana."

    "title": "Dynamics process of lead-zinc hydrolysis and characterization of its hydrolysis precipitates in a Pb-Zn-NaCl-H2O system at room temperature and pressure",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have confirmed the critical and essential role of elemental hydrolysis in metallogenic processes, such as metal migration and precipitation. However, the kinetic processes, characteristics, and formation mechanisms of hydrolyzed precipitates require further comprehensive investigation. This paper is based on a systematic investigation of the hydrolysis mechanisms of Pb and Zn in various systems under ambient temperature and pressure, the storage conditions of the hydrolyzed precipitates, and the characterization of these precipitates. The results indicate that the hydrolysis behaviors of Pb and Zn exhibit significant differences across various systems. Within the monometallic regime, there is a pronounced disparity in the hydrolysis rates between Pb ions and Zn ions. Pb ions demonstrate a substantially higher degree of hydrolysis, a trend that persists over time and remains largely unaffected by the \"fluid retention or isolation\" phenomenon in the surrounding environment. Both hydrolytic precipitation rates were observed to decrease in the mixed system, with Zn ions exhibiting less reduction than Pb ions. After hydrolysis, hydrolyzed precipitates can remain in the fluid environment for extended periods of time, which can lead to re-dissolution. Over time, this re-dissolution can increase, eventually leading to significant loss of hydrolyzed precipitates. The hydrolyzed precipitates obtained from the experiments primarily consisted of alkaline carbonates of Pb and Zn. Notably, the crystalline characteristics of the hydrolysis products of Pb and Zn ions exhibited significant differences across various experimental systems; however, the crystallographic characteristics of the primary hydrolysis products are essentially identical to those of their corresponding natural counterparts. Based on the findings from physical phase analysis and previous research, it is concluded that the hydrolysis process consists of three main stages: oxides/hydroxides, carbonates, and alkali carbonates. In the Pb-Zn-NaCl-H 2 O system, the proportion of the basic carbonate products of Pb and Zn is 6:2. This research offers an in-depth analysis of the hydrolysis dynamics of lead and zinc under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Furthermore, it characterizes the crystallization features of the hydrolyzed precipitates and reconstructs the three stages of the formation process. This study holds significant scientific value for understanding the metallogenic mechanisms of Pb and Zn."

    "abstract": "The Kanpur Nagar is an economically and industrially vibrant area situated on the Middle Gangetic alluvial plain which lacks robust hydrogeochemical data. Therefore, in the present research, hydrogeochemical techniques integrated with multi-statistical analysis were used to assess the geochemistry, sources of ions, geochemical evolution, natural background levels (NBLs), threshold values (TVs), and suitability for drinking purposes using the integrated-weight water quality index (IWQI) of 68 groundwater samples from both pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons. Additionally, an assessment was made of the sources and occurrence of fluoride and nitrate contaminants in the groundwater, followed by an evaluation of their associated non-carcinogenic human health risks (NCHHR) due to the oral consumption of F − , and NO − 3 . Silicate weathering was found to be the most influential geochemical process in the study area, followed by active cation exchange, with a significant contribution from anthropogenic sources. The study assessed the identification of geochemical factors that control high levels of chemical components in groundwater using NBLs and TVs. Values of IWQI indicate the occurrence of excellent and good quality potable water in 78% and 91% of the total groundwater samples from PRM and POM, respectively. As per the geochemical signature, the probable source of excess fluoride might be related to the interaction of groundwater with alluvial sediments deposited in the geological past, while agronomic sources could be the sole reasons for elevated nitrate concentration. It was found that children are more prone to NCHHR than the adult population, as per the calculated total hazard index."

    "abstract": "The Upper Paleocene–Lower Eocene Tura Formation, encountered in most oil wells of the Upper Assam Shelf, India, rests non-conformably over the Precambrian granitic basement. Its type section is well exposed in the West Garo Hills of Meghalaya, India. Petrographic and geochemical analyses of the sandstones have been employed to determine their provenance, tectonic setting, and prevailing paleoenvironmental conditions. The Tura sandstones are mainly classified as quartz arenite, sublitharenite, and some subarkosic types. Geochemical data, including trace elements and rare earth elements (REEs), indicate that the sandstones were predominantly derived from felsic sources. Tectonic discrimination diagrams suggest that the sandstones were deposited in an active margin setting. The sandstones were derived from source areas that experienced semi-humid to humid climatic conditions with moderate to intense degrees of chemical weathering, as indicated by paleoweathering indices such as the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA: 79.10), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW: 84.20), and Index of Compositional Variability (ICV: 7.67)."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the mercury (Hg) isotope geochemistry of pyrite from the Aketashi volcanic hosted massive sulfide (VMS) deposit in the West Kunlun Orogenic Belt, China, aiming to elucidate the sources of ore-forming fluids and the behavior of Hg isotopes during mineralization. The Aketashi deposit is located within a Late Paleozoic back-arc basin, which is characterized by extensive Carboniferous magmatism and hydrothermal activity. Analysis of 19 pyrite ore samples revealed Hg isotope composition with δ 202 Hg values ranging from −2.48‰ to 0.87‰ and Δ 199 Hg values from −0.02‰ to 0.40‰. The negative δ 202 Hg values are indicative of isotopic fractionation resulting from hydrothermal processes, whereas the positive Δ 199 Hg values imply a mixed fluid source comprising both magmatic and seawater-derived components. This study highlights the unique advantage of Hg isotopes in tracing multi-source fluid interactions (e.g., magmatic vs. seawater-derived) in VMS systems, providing a novel methodology for global metallogenic studies. Our findings not only resolve the long-standing debate on fluid origins at Aketashi but also establish a framework for applying Hg isotopes to other VMS deposits worldwide."

    "title": "Isotopic characterization (δ18O, δD and d-excess) and modelling of stream flow partitioning along an altitudinal gradient in the Satluj River basin (SRB) Himalayan-alluvial plain using end member mixing analysis (EMMA) and associated uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Stable isotopic ( δ 18 O, δ D and d -excess) signatures were employed to gain valuable insights regarding key hydrological processes and modelling of stream flow runoff partitioning of Satluj River Basin (SRB) in the western Himalayan region and plains of Punjab, where surface water is extensively used for hydropower, agricultural and domestic supply. The SRB has not yet been unexplored. Spatially extensive and comprehensive stable isotope data are meagre, which constricts the thoughtful comprehension of hydrological processes, sources of moisture, the isotope-elevation relationship and provenance quantification in this transboundary river across the mountain-plain basin. The results showed a significant difference in δ 18 O, δ D and d -excess among the main stream, tributaries and groundwater during the observed period, mainly regulated by snow-glacier melt input, evaporation and recycled moisture contribution. The deviation of the water line in each hydrological compartment from the Global Meteoric Water Line, as well as its similarity to the local, regional and local water lines, suggests that these compartments have undergone significant evaporation during the recharge process. This similarity in moisture dynamics implies a potential link between the local and regional hydrological systems. The isotopic signature integrated with back trajectories reflects the combined role of moisture sources via both westerlies and southwest monsoons followed by extensive local recycling. The isotopic altitude lapse rate (IALR) of the various hydrological compartments mimics the IALR results from the Himalayas and their surrounding catchments. Moreover, the isotopic composition ( δ 18 O) of the main stream showed a closer fit to a second-order polynomial relationship between δ 18 O and elevation compared to other models. Furthermore, we employ end member mixing analysis (EMMA) principles to identify the possible end members and calculate contributing fractions for respective end members. Modelling of stream flow partitioning using a dual isotopic tracer ( δ 18 O- EC and δ 18 O- d mixing model) based EMMA revealed the three possible end members, namely glacier melt, snow melt and groundwater, contributing 29.5%, 31.7% and 38.7%, respectively, via a δ 18 O-EC mixing model, while 29.6%, 31.3% and 39.0%, respectively, via a δ 18 O- d mixing model. The mathematically propagated uncertainty in the respective computed mixing fractions of EMMA is approximately 28%, 41% and 25% with the δ 18 O-EC mixing model and 19%, 54% and 35% with the δ 18 O- d mixing model, respectively, reflecting realistic uncertainties. An attempt is made to acknowledge, explore and hypothesize the realistic reason for the larger documented uncertainty. The study highlights the significant contribution of groundwater originating from the mountain-plain nexus to demarcate the river isotopic variability and underlines the need to concentrate on this important hydrological reservoir in the near future to learn about groundwater hysteresis and flow dynamics in this nexus mountain-plain watershed."

    "title": "In situ Raman spectroscopic investigation of copper speciation in hydrothermal fluids at temperatures up to 300 °C",
    "abstract": "The formation of copper deposits is closely related to hydrothermal processes. Understanding the migration of copper in hydrothermal fluids aids in reconstructing mineralization processes and deciphering deposit genesis. Copper primarily exists as Cu + and Cu 2+ in hydrothermal solutions, with redox conditions governing their interconversion. In chloride-rich geological fluids, Cu–Cl complexes are considered critical for copper transport. However, the specific types and valence transitions of Cu–Cl complexes under varying hydrothermal conditions remain poorly understood. This study employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to systematically analyze Cu + HCl and CuCl 2 + K 2 S 2 O 3 /H 2 systems under saturated vapor pressure at 25–300 °C, elucidating the effects of temperature, Cl − concentration, and redox conditions on copper speciation. In the Cu + HCl system, copper dissolved as monovalent Cu–Cl complexes. At high temperatures (> 200 °C), [CuCl 2 ] − is the dominated species, whereas [CuCl 3 ] 2− becomes prevalent at lower temperatures and higher HCl concentrations. For the Cu 2+ –Cl system, the dominant species transitioned from [Cu(H 2 O) n ] 2+ (< 50 °C) to [CuCl 4 ] 2− (100 °C) and further to [CuCl] + and [CuCl 2 ] 0 at 300 °C. The introduction of reducing agents (K 2 S 2 O 3 /H 2 ) facilitated Cu 2+ → Cu + reduction, thereby stabilizing Cu + –Cl complexes and inducing partial copper precipitation. The behavior of copper in chloride-rich hydrothermal fluids observed in this study indicates that high-temperature oxidizing fluids facilitate Cu mobilization, while cooling and redox changes promote deposition and ore minerals formation."

In this study, we present detailed field, petrography, and whole rock geochemistry of the Mahakoshal metabasalts. The Mahakoshal metabasalts are sub-alkaline in nature and belong to the tholeiitic series of rocks. The variation in rare-earth element patterns of metabasalts indicates the different degrees of partial melting at shallow as well as deeper depths. Further, Eu/Eu* varies from 0.8 to 1.1 (except sample KP-144=0.3), Ce/Ce* varies from 0.97 to 1.05, showing no cerium anomaly, and Nb/Nb* ranges from 0.7 to 1.3 (except KP-144=0.1). The magnesium number (Mg#) varies from 0.2 to 0.3, which is quite low, indicating the evolved nature of the metabasalts. The studied metabasalts show E-MORB to OIB-type affinities, which are placed in the trench-distal back-arc setting. The opening of the Mahakoshal Basin is due to retreating orogen in the accretionary orogen setting and is contemporaneous with the assembly of the Columbia Supercontinent (~2.1–1.8 Ga). Hence, field, petrographic, and geochemical signatures indicate that the Mahakoshal basin opened as a back-arc rift basin on the Bundelkhand Craton, and that metabasalts are derived from the mantle that underwent variable degrees of partial melting at different depths."

    "title": "The Jalilabad copper deposit in the Tarom-Hashjin magmatic belt, NW Iran:Epithermal or porphyry deposit? Evidence from geology, alteration, geochemistry, fluid inclusions, and stable isotope studies",
    "abstract": "The Jalilabad Cu (± Au) deposit lies in the central section of the Tarom-Hashjin Metallogenic Belt, in northern Zanjan Province, NW Iran. Mineralization predominantly occurs within quartz-sulfide veins, veinlets, and breccia zones, primarily hosted by the Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic units of the Karaj Formation. The mineralization trends NW–SE and is influenced by several strike-slip faults. Chalcopyrite and bornite are the principal hypogene sulfides, with chalcocite and covellite representing the supergene stage. The post-ore stage is characterized by brecciated calcite and quartz. Geochemical analyses show that the monzonite intrusion contains SiO₂ levels ranging from 69.80 to 70.24 wt.%, K₂O+Na₂O values between 8.10 and 8.15 wt.%, and K₂O/Na₂O ratios of 1.36 to 1.61. The intrusion is enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs) while being depleted in high-field-strength elements (HFSEs). A low Hf/Sm ratio indicates an orogenic-related magma, and a low Nb/La ratio points to a depleted mantle source. Microthermometric studies of three quartz types reveal moderate to high formation temperatures (195.4–322.7 °C) and salinities ranging from 8.10 to 11.82 wt.% NaCl equiv . Oxygen isotope data ( δ 18 O H2O O) range from +4.8‰ to +8.1‰, suggesting a magmatic origin for the ore-forming fluids, later diluted by meteoric water. Sulfur isotope values ( δ 34 S H2S ) between −6.0‰ and −9.1‰ confirm a magmatic source. Fluid mixing and dilution are identified as the primary mechanisms for ore precipitation. Raman spectroscopy enables nondestructive identification of minerals through their unique vibrational peaks. Chalcopyrite (213, 280, 1304 cm −1 ), hematite (214, 282, 469, 689, 1309 cm −1 ), goethite (967 cm −1 ), and quartz (125, 198, 458 cm −1 ) show distinct spectral fingerprints indicating mineral differentiation, alteration tracking, and structural analysis in geological studies. Based on its geological context, the Jalilabad Cu (± Au) deposit is interpreted as resembling a high-sulfidation epithermal deposit."

    "title": "Extraction of deep mineralization information from weak and low tectono-geochemical anomalies: A case study of the Maoping germanium-rich lead–zinc deposit in northeastern Yunnan Province, China",
    "abstract": "Tectono-geochemical analysis is one of the key technical methods for deep prospecting and prediction, but the extraction of information on weak and low degrees of mineralization remains a significant challenge. This study takes the Maoping super-large germanium-rich lead–zinc deposit in northeastern Yunnan as an example, systematically analyzes the mineralization element assemblages and their anomaly distribution characteristics, extracts information on low and weak anomalies at depth, clarifies the spatial distribution of ore-forming element anomalies and fluid migration patterns, and establishes tectono-geochemical deep anomaly evaluation criteria and prospecting models, thereby proposing directions for deep prospecting in the deposit. This research shows that the mineralization element assemblage of the F1 factor (Cd-Cu-Ge-Zn-Sb-In-Pb-Sr(-)-As-Hg) anomalies represents near-ore halos; the element assemblage of the F2 factor (Ni-Co-Cr-Rb-Ga) anomalies represents tail halos; the element assemblage of the F3 factor (Rb-Mo-Tl-As) anomalies represents front halos; and the element assemblage of the F4 factor (Ba-Ga) anomalies represents barite alteration anomalies. Elements such as Zn and Pb exhibit significant anomalies near the lead–zinc ore bodies. In the study area, vertical anomalies in the eastern region of the Luoze River indicate that ore-forming fluids migrated from the SE at depth to the NW at shallower levels, whereas in the western region, ore-forming fluids migrated from the SW at depth to the NE at shallower levels. Thus, the lateral extensions of different ore bodies in the eastern and western regions of the river have been determined. On this basis, tectono-geochemical deep anomaly evaluation criteria for the deposit are established, and directions for deep prospecting are proposed. This study provides scientific value and practical significance for deep prospecting and exploration engineering planning for similar lead–zinc deposits."

    "title": "Triassic diorites in the Qinling orogen: Underappreciated role for gold metallogeny in continental collision orogenic belt",
    "abstract": "The Triassic granitoids and associated diorites in the Qinling orogenic belt reveal critical evidence of crust–mantle interaction during the terminal collision between the North China and Yangtze Blocks. This study presents new constraints from zircon U–Pb age, Lu–Hf isotopes, and amphibole-plagioclase-apatite geochemistry for the Maoerliang diorite in the Foping area. Zircon U–Pb dating yields a crystallization age of 212 ± 2.8 Ma, with εHf(t) values ranging from −8.6 to +3.0 and corresponding two-stage Hf model ages (T DM2 ) of 886–1479 Ma, indicative of derivation from an evolved lithospheric mantle source. Petrogenetic indicators reveal a mantle affinity: amphiboles exhibit high MgO (9.8–11.2 wt%) and elevated Nb/Ta ratios (14.3–18.1), while apatites display F-rich (2.1–2.8 wt%) and Cl-poor (0.08–0.15 wt%) characteristics. Thermobarometric calculations based on amphibole chemistry constrain crystallization conditions of 805–866 °C and 211–383 MPa, corresponding to mid-crustal emplacement depths (8–14 km). Both amphibole and zircon indicate elevated oxygen fugacity (ΔNNO = −4.08 to −3.71; ∆FMQ = −1.14 to +3.96) and hydrous magma conditions (H 2 O = 4.22–4.94 wt%). Late-stage plagioclase crystallization (An21–26.5) reflects prolonged fractional crystallization in a hydrous dioritic magma. These diagnostic features—mantle-derived signatures, high f O 2 , and hydrous nature—exhibit remarkable convergence with gold-mineralized granites in the East Qinling. Our findings suggest that Triassic dioritic magmatism may have played an underappreciated role in facilitating gold enrichment processes within the South Qinling metallogenic belt."

    "title": "Statistical Prediction of In Situ Coral Reef Carbonate Dynamics Using Endmember Chemistry, Hydrodynamic Models, And Benthic Composition",
    "abstract": "In the face of rapidly compounding climate change impacts, including ocean acidification (OA), it is critical to understand present-day stress exposure and to anticipate the biogeochemical conditions experienced by vulnerable ecosystems like coral reefs. To meaningfully predict nearshore carbonate chemistry, we must account for the complexity of the local benthic community, as well as connectivity between habitats and relevant endmember carbonate chemistry. Here, we adopt a system-scale approach to predict site-scale effects of benthic metabolism on the carbonate system of the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). We utilize bimonthly carbonate chemistry data from ten cross-shelf transects spanning 250 km of the FRT to model changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA). Benthic habitat maps were used to broadly classify communities known to impact carbonate chemistry. A SLIM 2D hydrodynamic model with mesh resolution reaching 100 m over reefs and along the coastline was used to determine the relevant water mass histories and identify the upstream benthic communities shaping local carbonate chemistry. These historical metabolic footprints, or “flowsheds”, were used to build predictive models of the change in DIC and TA at each station. The best predictive models included the chemical impacts of benthic ecosystem metabolism, as defined by water mass trajectories, weighted endmember chemistry, volume, time, and other environmental parameters (light, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, and nitrate). Considering water mass for 5 days prior to sample collection yielded the highest model skill."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the biogeochemical and environmental characteristics of humic acids isolated from sediment samples of five lakes located in the European taiga zone. Sediment samples were analyzed using advanced techniques, including CHN analysis, solid-state 13C-NMR spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy. The results show that the humic acids from the studied lake sediments exhibit lower degrees of aromaticity compared to those in terrestrial soils, indicating a lower degree of humification under aquatic reducing conditions. This suggests that aquatic environments favor the preservation of relatively labile organic compounds. The affinity of metals to form complexes with the humic acids varied among the lakes, with metals such as Co, Pb, V, and Sb forming stable chelate complexes, while Mn and Cd exhibited higher geochemical mobility. The findings provide insight into the role of humic substances in controlling the distribution and mobility of metals in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to our understanding of biogeochemical processes in taiga lake environments."

    "title": "Geochemical Behaviour and Influencing Factors of Salt-Forming Elements in Lithium-Rich Salt Lake Region: A Case Study from the Nalenggele River Basin, Qaidam Basin",
    "abstract": "To deepen the comprehension of the geochemical behaviour of salt-forming elements (K, Li, B, Ca, Mg, Sr) and distribution patterns in the primary lithium-rich salt lake region of Qaidam Basin, 31 river and lake surface sediments from various hydrogeological settings spanning high mountain to terminal salt lake regions were gathered from the Nalenggele River, the primary feeder river of the lithium-rich salt lakes. Through sequential extraction procedure, we identified notable variances in the chemical speciation of elements across various hydrological environments. Excluding elements bound to the residual fraction, all other chemical speciation content of salt-forming elements show distinct regional variations, suggesting a predominant influence of evaporation and hydrodynamic and the inherent chemical properties of elements are also very important in determining their chemical speciation distribution characteristics. Meanwhile, we have found that in addition to being absorbed and fixed by secondary clay minerals, Li bound to Fe–Mn oxides may also play a crucial role in Li isotope fractionation from the river to the terminal salt lake brine and the precipitation of evaporation salt minerals could influence the B isotope fractionation to a certain extent. Furthermore, The Li and B lost to sediments during the migration process have potential utility and there is scope for enhanced exploitation in the future. Therefore, the results obtained from the sequential extraction procedure of sediments evidently serve as a valuable method for understanding the geochemical behaviour of salt-forming elements in the epigenetic environment."

    "title": "Direct Salinity Effect on Absorbance and Fluorescence of Chernozem Water-Extractable Organic Matter",
    "abstract": "Soil-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) has a significant impact on aquatic ecosystems. Identifying the fluorescence signatures of DOM from different soils in river and sea waters can provide valuable insights into its migration patterns. This makes crucial assessing the contributions of pH, salinity, and other milieu parameters to the variability of DOM optical properties. Present study investigates the changes in DOM of Chernozems under varying salinity using UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy and 3D-fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC). Water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) extracted from soils of two field experiments of contrasting land use: long-term bare fallow (LTBF) and annually mown steppe (Steppe), was used as a proxy for DOM. Diluted extracts were incubated with varying NaCl concentrations in the dark and then examined. Steppe WEOM exhibited fair constancy of optical parameters under increasing salinity, while significant changes of the optical indices and of PARAFAC components’s loadings were observed for LTBF WEOM. The remarkable stability of the Steppe WEOM can be attributed to its chemical diversity. Two distinct and sufficiently stable humic-like PARAFAC components have the potential to serve as markers of Chernozem DOM. The findings clearly demonstrate that salinity itself slightly reduces absorption and fluorescence and changes some optical indices of WEOM of Chernozems."

    "title": "Oxygen Consumption of Resuspended Sediments of the Upper Elbe Estuary: Process Identification and Prognosis",
    "abstract": "The resuspension of sediment leads to an increased release of nutrients and organic substances into the overlying water column, which can have a negative effect on the oxygen budget. Especially in the warmer months with a lower oxygen saturation and higher biological activity, the oxygen content can reach critical thresholds in estuaries like the upper Elbe estuary. Many studies have dealt with the nutrient fluxes that occur during a resuspension event. However, the sediment properties that influence the oxygen consumption potential (OCP) and the different biochemical processes have not been examined in detail. To fill this gap, we investigated the biogeochemical composition, texture, and OCP of sediments at 21 locations as well as the temporal variability within one location for a period of 2 years (monthly sampling) in the upper Elbe estuary. The OCP of sediments during a seven-day resuspension event can be described by the processes of sulphate formation, nitrification, and mineralisation. Chlorophyll, total nitrogen ( N total ), and total organic carbon showed the highest correlations with the OCP. Based on these correlations, we developed a prognosis model to calculate the OCP for the upper Elbe estuary with a single sediment parameter ( N total ). The model is well suited to calculate the oxygen consumption of resuspended sediments in the Hamburg port area during the relevant warmer months and shows a normalised root mean squared error of < 0.11 ± 0.13. Thus, the effect of maintenance measures such as water injection dredging and ship-induced wave on the oxygen budget of the water can be calculated."

    "title": "Origin and Evolution of Deep K-Rich Confined Brine in Mahai Basin, Qinghai–Tibet Plateau",
    "abstract": "Mahai Basin (MH), located in the northern Qaidam Basin (QB), possesses abundant K-rich brine resources. The investigation on the origin of deep K-rich confined brine and the variations in K–Mg elements corresponding to the evolution in MH shed light on the significance of assessment and utilization of brine deposits. This study presents multiple isotopes (δ 18 O–δD, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and hydrochemical characteristics for various waters (including river water, surface brine, intercrystalline brine, confined brine and anticlinal brine) in the MH. Our findings corroborate that: (1) confined brine exhibits relatively high K + (average value of 6.88 g/L) and low Ca 2+ –Sr 2+ concentrations, compared to anticlinal brine, and its chemical composition resembles the evolution of Yuqia River in Ca–SO 4 –HCO 3 diagram, suggesting that contemporary river water is the primary source of confined brine. (2) The δ 18 O–δD values of confined brine in MH ranged from − 17.80 to − 27.40‰ and 1.50 to 2.40‰, respectively, and fall on the right field of the local evaporation line, indicating successive evaporation and concentration processes. (3) The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0.71142–0.71145) of confined brine fall between river water (0.71150–0.71183) and anticlinal brine (0.71135), combining with river water and confined brine which exhibit low Sr content, and further confirming the origin of confined brine is a mixture by river and anticlinal brine and much river recharge budget. (4) Considering the evolution of sedimentary facies (Dezongmahai Lake area as an example) and the gradual increase in K and Mg contents in MH, the enrichment of K and Mg exhibits a certain correlation with the evolution of MH. Notably, the brine in the northeast of the basin displays the highest levels of K and Mg, indicating that this region serves as the ultimate depositional center."

    "title": "Aggregation and Dispersion Behaviours of Riverine Trace Metals (Fe, Al, V, Mn, Ni, and Zn) and Organic Matter in Freshwater and Estuarine Conditions: A case study in Shira and Midori Rivers, Kumamoto, Japan",
    "abstract": "The aggregation and dispersion of metals and organic matter are an important morphological alteration process for their transportation and bioavailability in coastal areas. However, variable mixing behaviours can be observed for some substances (e.g. Mn and Cu) due to the variable interaction systems in natural systems. In this study, riverine freshwater in the Shira and Midori rivers, Kumamoto, Japan, was mixed with artificial seawater to investigate the aggregation and dispersion behaviours of trace metals (i.e. Fe, Al, Mn, Zn, Cu, V, and Ni) and organic matter. In particular, their interactions were examined with differentiating the fast and slow transformations and considering the effects of suspended substances. Comparisons of sequential processes, including seawater mixing, decantation, centrifugation, and multiple filtrations, illustrated the aggregation and dispersion characteristics of the metals and organic matter as follows. A strong aggregating nature was evident for Fe in estuarine systems. In addition, the slow aggregation of Fe was accelerated by river-borne suspended substances. Small Fe (oxy)hydroxide particles were the major forms of dissolved Fe in both freshwater and estuarine systems and were partly associated with the other metals. In contrast, Zn and Ni were characterised by strong dispersion properties, although it can resorb onto suspended substances in estuarine systems. Synchronous behaviours with Zn and Ni were observed for V, Cu, and organic matter in the Midori River. The adsorption of Mn onto suspended substances was evident in the freshwater systems instead of the estuarine systems. Meanwhile, the behaviour of Mn is known to be dependent on its abundance in suspended forms, its redox state, and the influence of Fe. V and Cu, which are non-conservative in nature, were affected by other metals such as Fe, Zn, and Ni. Al, whose behaviour is largely dependent on the target estuary, which was also affected by other metals. Slow aggregation of organic matter was induced by suspended substances which were produced by fast transformation. In addition, evident interactions between suspended and dissolved substances were observed with the behaviours of Fe, Zn, Ni, and organic matter, indicating that the deposition and dispersion at the early stage of estuarine mixing can influence the subsequent slow transformation in real environments."

    "title": "The Abiotic Nitrite Oxidation by Ligand-Bound Manganese (III): The Chemical Mechanism",
    "abstract": "Given their environmental abundances, it has been long hypothesized that geochemical interactions between reactive forms of manganese and nitrogen may play important roles in the cycling of these elements. Indeed, recent studies have begun shedding light on the possible role of soluble, ligand-bound Mn(III) in promoting abiotic transformations under environmentally relevant conditions. Here, using the kinetic data of Karolewski et al. (Geochim Cosmochim Acta 293:365–378, 2021), we provide the chemical mechanism for the abiotic oxidation of nitrite (NO 2 − ) by Mn(III)-pyrophosphate, Mn III PP, to form nitrate (NO 3 − ). Nitrous acid (HNO 2 ), not NO 2 − , is the reductant in the reaction, based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. As soluble Mn(III) complexes react in a one-electron transfer reaction, two one-electron transfer steps must occur. In step one, HNO 2 is first oxidized to nitrogen dioxide, ·NO 2 , a free radical via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction. We show that this inner sphere reaction process is the rate-limiting step in the reaction sequence. In step two, ·NO 2 reacts with a second Mn III PP complex to form the nitronium ion (NO 2 + ), which is isoelectronic with CO 2 . Unlike the poor electron-accepting capability of CO 2 , NO 2 + is an excellent electron acceptor for both OH − and H 2 O, so NO 2 + reacts quickly with water to form the end-product NO 3 − (step 3 in the reaction sequence). Thus, water provides the O atom in this nitrification reaction in accordance with the O-isotope data. This work provides mechanistic perspective on a potentially important interaction between Mn and nitrogen species, thereby offering a framework in which to interpret kinetic and isotopic data and to further investigate the relevance of this reaction under environmental conditions."

    "title": "Quantification of Post-monsoon CO2 Degassing Flux from the Headwaters of the Ganga River: Emphasis on Weathering Pattern of the Basin",
    "abstract": "Research on the carbon-cycling process in high-altitude streams is crucial for understanding whether carbon acts as a source or sink for the atmosphere during present times of global climate change. In this study, we have quantified the post-monsoon CO 2 flux (FCO 2 ) from the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers, which are two pristine watersheds in the Upper Ganga Basin in India with the help of analytical hydrochemistry and PHREEQC v.3.7.3 software. Our results show FCO 2 values of 88 gCO 2 m⁻ 2 d⁻ 1 and 175 gCO 2 m⁻ 2 d⁻ 1 from the upstream reaches of Bhagirathi and Alaknanda Rivers, respectively, which is significantly greater than the fluxes observed in the downstream reaches (18 gCO 2 m⁻ 2 d⁻ 1 and 4.1 gCO 2 m⁻ 2 d⁻ 1 , respectively). This difference in FCO 2 is attributed to the major variation in gas transfer velocity (kCO₂) along elevation, with the upstream section exhibiting approximately eight times higher kCO 2 than the downstream section. The steeper bed slope leads to increased turbulence and energy dissipation at higher altitudes, enhancing the kCO 2 values. The partial pressure of CO 2 in the rivers was found to be approximately 2.5 times greater than the atmosphere. Our findings suggest that form-drag turbulence instead of bed friction, prevalent in the high-gradient reaches of the rivers, is the main driver of CO 2 degassing into the atmosphere. This study shows that Ganga headwater streams are sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere and underscores the need for monitoring other Himalayan streams for CO 2 flux."

    "title": "Unraveling the Role of Capillarity in Arsenic Mobility: Insights from a Sedimentary–Karstic Aquifer in Semiarid Soil",
    "abstract": "Arsenic (As) contamination in soil and groundwater poses significant environmental and human health concerns. While chemical mechanisms like solubility equilibria, oxidation–reduction, and ionic exchange reactions have been studied to understand As retention in soil, the influence of capillarity on As transport remains poorly understood, particularly in semiarid soils with broader capillary fringes. This research aims to shed light on the capillary contribution to As attenuation and mobilization in the groundwater, focusing on degraded soil in the northeast of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. Groundwater surveys revealed a remarkable depletion of As concentrations from 91.50 to 11.27 mg L −1 , indicating potential As sorption by the underlying shallow aquifer. We examined soil samples collected from the topsoil to the saturated zone using advanced analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and wet chemical analyses. Our findings unveiled the presence of three distinct zones in the soil column: (1) the A horizon with heavy metals, (2) dispersed calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals and stratified gypsum, and (3) a higher concentration of arsenic in the capillary fringe. Notably, the capillary fringe exhibited a significant accumulation of As, constituting 40% (169.22 mg kg −1 ) of the total arsenic proportion accumulated (359.27 mg kg −1 ). The arsenic behavior in the capillary fringe solid phase correlated with total iron behavior, but they were distributed among different mineral fractions. The labile fraction, rich in arsenic, contrasted with the more recalcitrant fractions, which exhibited higher iron content. Further, thermodynamic stability assessments using the geochemical code PHREEQC revealed the critical role of Ca 5 H 2 (AsO 4 ) 4 :9H 2 O in controlling HAsO 4 2− and the formation of HAsO 4 :2H 2 O and CaHAsO 4 :H 2 O. During experimentation, we observed arsenate dissolution, indicating the potential mobilization of As in aqueous species. This mobilization was found to vary depending on redox conditions and may become labile during flooding events or water table variations, especially when As concentrations are low compared to metal cations, as demonstrated in our experiments. Our research underscores the significance of developing accurate geochemical conceptual models that incorporate capillarity to predict As leaching and remobilization accurately. This study presents novel insights into the understanding of As transport mechanisms and suggests the necessity of considering capillarity in geochemical models. By comprehending the capillary contribution to As attenuation, we can develop effective strategies to mitigate As contamination in semiarid soils and safeguard groundwater quality, thereby addressing crucial environmental and public health concerns."

    "title": "Free Eu(III) Determination by Donnan Membrane Technique with Electrochemical Detection: Implementation and Evaluation",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop an analytical method to determine free concentrations of Europium (Eu(III)) in natural waters. Europium(III) in solution was detected using cathodic stripping voltammetry after complexation with N -nitroso- N -phenylhydroxylamine (cupferron). Optimization of analytical parameters allowed us to detect nanomolar levels of Eu(III) in solution. Free Eu(III) in solution was measured using the Donnan membrane technique in which a natural solution (the “donor”, containing various ligands) is separated from a ligand-free solution (the “acceptor”) by a cation-exchange membrane. This membrane allows only non-colloidal cationic species to pass through it, and after an adequate time equilibrium is reached between both compartments. Total Eu(III) concentration can then be quantified in the acceptor solution and related to free Eu(III) in the natural sample. Due to its high valency, free Eu(III) tends to adsorb strongly to the cation-exchange membrane. In order to determine the physicochemical conditions minimizing this adsorption, we analyzed solutions of different Eu(III) and Ca(II) (as background ion) concentrations. Results showed that 100 mM of Ca(II) were necessary to make adsorption of Eu(III) onto the membrane negligible. The optimized setup was then used to quantify Eu(III) complexation in a Eu(III)-dissolved organic matter solution."

    "title": "Microbial Acid Sulfate Weathering of Basaltic Rocks: Implication for Enzymatic Reactions",
    "abstract": "Two basaltic rocks were reacted in acid sulfate and non-acid sulfate solutions with an initial pH value of 2 in the presence and absence of A. ferrooxidans to determine if basalt dissolution can support the metabolically active growth of A. ferrooxidans . Similar elemental release rates ( R Si , R Ca , R Mg ) calculated for both biotic and abiotic experiments suggest rather a negligible microbial impact on the dissolution of basaltic rocks within the acid sulfate solution. Nevertheless, in contrast with the abiotic experiments, measurements of remarkably high concentration of Fe(III) aq in microbial experiments confirmed the bacterial metabolism. Moreover, detected cell division and increasing total cell numbers with the extent of the experiments provide further evidence for the growth of metabolically active A. ferrooxidans during the dissolution of the rocks. Formation of jarosite ((K, Na, H 3 O)Fe 3 (SO 4 ) 2 (OH) 6 ) only in the biotic experiments is attributed to the microbially catalyzed Fe(II) aq oxidation. Overall, our results showed that acidic solutions that reacted with basaltic rocks can sustain the growth of Fe(II) aq oxidizing bacteria. Furthermore, identification of jarosite only in the biotic experiments emphasizes the enzymatic Fe(II) oxidation as the key step for its formation during basalt weathering at acid conditions, highlighting its biosignature potential on Earth and Earth-like planets (e.g., Mars)."

    "title": "A Late Holocene Record of Variations in the Chemical Weathering Intensity and Pedogenesis in a Lake Catchment from Southern India",
    "abstract": "We investigated the detrital influx, chemical weathering intensity, provenance and pedogenesis over the past 2,500 years in the catchment of Pookot Lake, southern India. The down-core variations of metal/Al ratios (Na/Al, K/Al, Mg/Al, Ca/Al, Fe/Al, Mn/Al, Zn/Al, Ba/Al) of the Pookot sediments indicate changes in the rainfall-induced terrigenous inflow to the lake. In contrast, fluctuations in the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and Rb/Sr values denote the variability in the strength of chemical weathering in the watershed of the lake. The results show that the detrital influx, and hence rainfall, remained steady except during 1500–600 cal. years B.P. (high) and 600–300 cal. year B.P. (low) in the Pookot lake catchment. However, the periods of high/low chemical weathering intensity in the catchment do not correspond to periods of high/low detrital influx to the lake basin. The similar shale-normalized rare earth elemental curves point to a uniform provenance. The past pedogenic activity is indicated by pedogenic χ lf and pedogenic χ fd derived from citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD) extraction. The data indicate that the fine-grained magnetite/maghemite formed during the pedogenesis mainly contributes to the magnetic signal of sediments. The degree of pedogenesis was strong during 2500–2000 cal. years B.P. and moderate throughout 1500–600 cal. years B.P. The pedogenic intensity became stronger again during ~ 600 cal. years B.P., which weakened between 600 and 300 cal. years B.P. and remained steady thereafter. The present study indicates that detrital influx proxies like metal/Al ratios are more suitable for reconstructing past climate in tropical climate rather than chemical weathering indices."

    "title": "Effect of Ionic Strength on H2O and Si-Species Stability Field Geometry in pH-Eh Space",
    "abstract": "Speciation diagrams in pH-Eh space at some pressure, temperature, and composition are highly useful in indicating the thermodynamic behavior expected in a system. While these diagrams are found frequently throughout geochemical literature, they often overlook the geometric behavior of stability fields and fail to address the specific impacts of ionic strength and fluid composition. Modeling results from the Salton Sea and Krafla geothermal sites suggest a positive correlation between ionic strength and the H 2 O (l) stability field area or reactivity domain. In addition, the Si-bearing species (selected due to the propensity of adverse scale occurrence) within the Salton Sea brine are shifted farther apart than the centroids of the same Si species in the comparatively dilute Krafla. These modeling observations imply that geothermal brines at equilibrium accommodate a larger H 2 O reactive field in pH-Eh space, allowing for the possibility that water–rock interactions could occur at pH-Eh conditions that would conventionally be unexpected if ionic strength is not considered."

    "title": "Geochemistry of Limestone from the Douala Sub-basin, Cameroon: Implications on Diagenesis, Depositional Environment and Paleotemperature",
    "abstract": "The geochemistry of limestone from Nkapa and Logbajeck formations, Douala sub-basin, has been studied using major, trace elements and stable isotopes in order to decipher paleo-redox condition, depositional and post-depositional imprints and paleotemperature . Collectively, U/Th Ni/Co, V (V + N), V/Cr and Ce/Ce* ratios clearly indicate an oxic depositional condition for the samples. The ratios of Mn/Sr suggest less significant diagenetic alteration on limestone composition. The carbon isotopic signals δ 13 C ranged from − 0.26 to 0.86‰ PDB while oxygen isotope δ 18 O is from − 2.24 to − 7.94‰.‰ PDB. The isotopic composition of δ 13 C (− 1.9 to 0.79‰) shows a discrepancy from modern carbonate sediments. The poor correlation and scattered distribution of δ 13 C versus δ 18 O plot in calcareous sediments reflect different degrees of burial diagenesis and/or the potential impact of meteoric water. The average estimated temperature of formation for the limestone is 44.08 °C revealing a warm period during its deposition. The paleosalinity values (Z) for the studied area vary from 111.45 to 127.11‰ indicating a marine to fresh water depositional environment. The δ 13 O versus δ 18 O bivariate diagram indicates that the limestone is predominantly marine limestone, freshwater limestone, late cement and Pleistocene limestone."

    "title": "Geochemical Proxies and Mineralogical Fingerprints of Sedimentary Processes in a Closed Shallow Lake Basin Since 1850",
    "abstract": "Lake systems are essential for the environment, the biosphere, and humans but are highly impacted by anthropogenic activities accentuated by climate change. Understanding how lake ecosystems change due to human impacts and natural forces is crucial to managing their current state and possible future restoration. The high sensitivity of shallow closed lakes to natural and anthropogenic forcing makes these lacustrine ecosystems highly prone to variations in precipitation and sedimentation processes. These variation processes, occurring in the water column, produce geochemical markers or proxies recorded in lake sedimentary archives. This study investigated specific proxies on high-resolution sedimentary archives (2–3 years resolution) of the Trasimeno lake (Central Italy). The Trasimeno lake underwent three different hydrological phases during the twentieth century due to several fluctuations induced mainly by human activities and climate change. The Trasimeno lake, a large and shallow basin located in the Mediterranean area, is a good case study to assess the effects of intense anthropogenic activity related to agriculture, tourism, industry, and climate changes during the Anthropocene. The aim is to identify the main characteristics of the main sedimentary events in the lake during the last 150 years, determining the concentrations of major and trace elements, the amount of organic matter, and the mineralogical composition of the sediments. This type of work demonstrates that studying sediment archives at high resolution is a viable method for reconstructing the lake’s history through the evolution/trends of the geochemical proxies stored in the sediment records. This effort makes it possible to assess past anthropogenic impact and, under the objectives of the European Green Deal (zero-pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment), to monitor, prevent, and remedy pollution related to soil and water compartments.

    "title": "Carbonate Alkalinity Enhances Triclosan Photolysis",
    "abstract": "Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial compound found in many household products used across the world. TCS is not completely removed in wastewater systems, resulting in trace-level concentrations present ubiquitously in surface waters. The direct photodegradation of TCS has been widely studied, with results indicating that TCS breaks down to chlorophenols and dioxins. To date, no studies have specifically investigated the effects of alkalinity on the photolysis of the acidic form of TCS. This study assessed the effect of carbonate/bicarbonate alkalinity, which is ubiquitous in natural waters, on the photolysis rate of TCS. Results indicate that bicarbonate enhances the photodegradation of TCS at pH values well below the p K a of TCS (7.9), with direct photolysis reaction kinetics that are very slow in the absence of buffers, but significant in the presence of bicarbonate (0.711 h −1 at pH 6.55). At pH values well above its p K a , both unbuffered- and buffered-mediated photolysis increased dramatically (1.92 h −1 for direct photolysis and 2.86 h −1 in buffered water) and is attributable to the increased photoreactivity of TCS by its conjugate base. Photolysis of methyl triclosan (MeTCS), a non-acidic analog of TCS, demonstrated the importance of TCS’s acidic functionality as MeTCS did not degrade at any pH. The observed influence of alkalinity on the acidic form of TCS photolysis was attributed to both a decrease in its excited state p K a , coupled with TCS deprotonation through an excited state proton transfer to a base (bicarbonate and to a lesser degree hydrogen phosphate) resulting in the more photo-labile conjugate base form of TCS."

    "title": "Predicting Coral Reef Carbonate Chemistry Through Statistical Modeling: Constraining Nearshore Residence Time Around Guam",
    "abstract": "To accurately predict the impacts of ocean acidification on shallow-water ecosystems, we must account for the biogeochemical impact of local benthic communities, as well as the connectivity between offshore and onshore water masses. Estimation of residence time can help quantify this connectivity and determine the degree to which the benthos can influence the chemistry of the overlying water column. We present estimates of nearshore residence time for Guam and utilize these estimates to model the effects of benthic ecosystem metabolism on the coral reef carbonate system. Control volume and particle tracking approaches were used to estimate nearshore residence time. These estimates were paired with observed patterns in the reef carbonate system around Guam using water samples collected by NOAA’s National Coral Reef Monitoring Program. Model performance results suggest that when considering the effects of benthic metabolism on the carbonate system, it is paramount to represent the contact time of the water volume with the benthos. Even coarse estimates of residence time significantly increase model skill. We observed the highest predictive skill in models including control volume derived estimates of residence time, but only when those estimates were included as an interaction with benthic composition. This work shows that not only is residence time critically important to better predict biogeochemical variability in coral reef environments, but that even coarse hydrodynamic models can provide useful residence time estimates at management relevant, whole-ecosystem scales."

    "title": "Mechanisms Underlying the Bromine Anomaly in the Brine of the Jingbian Gas Field, Ordos Basin, Northwestern China",
    "abstract": "Bromine (Br) is a vital chemical raw material primarily obtained from marine brine. The bromine/chlorine (Br/Cl) ratio serves as a crucial indicator for predicting marine potash mineralization in evaporites. As salinity increases, bromine gradually accumulates through evaporation in residual brine. During the process of brine evaporation to the potassium salt stage, the bromine content in the brine can exceed 1000 ppm. The marine brine sourced from the weathering crust reservoir at the top of the Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the Jingbian gas field, Ordos Basin, in northwestern China, displays an exceptionally high bromine content (averaging 1590 ppm), surpassing levels found in contemporary seawater. Based on analysis of major compositions, only brine evaporates to the gypsum stage. Despite extensive exploration in the region, large-scale potassium salt deposits have not been identified. This heightened concentration of bromine in low salinity brine suggests supplementation from additional organic bromine sources. The strata adjacent to the high-bromine oil field water in the Jingbian gas field, Ordos Basin, consist of the Ordovician marine evaporite strata of the Majiagou Formation and the overlying Carboniferous and Permian marine and continental deposits rich in fossil algae. Interactions between hydrocarbons and oilfield water contribute to the notable bromine anomaly observed in the Jingbian gas field in the Ordos Basin. Elevated bromine levels have also been noted in brine from various oil fields worldwide. Through an analysis of the major compositions of brines and bromine, this study will elucidate the reasons behind the presence of high bromine brines."

    "title": "MTMF Method for Hydromagnesite Determination Based on Landsat8 and ZY1-02D Data: A Case Study of the Jiezechaka Salt Lake in Tibet",
    "abstract": "Hydromagnesite (HM for short) is a natural carbonate mineral that is widely distributed. It is a high-quality mineral raw material for preparing flame retardants, magnesium oxides, heavy/light basic magnesium carbonates, magnesium hydroxides, and other Mg products. The evaluation of HM resources is of great significance to the development and utilization of salt lake resources. Using remote sensing technology to observe HM resources in salt lake can overcome the shortcomings of traditional prospecting methods such as discontinuous spatial data, time and effort. In addition, spectral analysis is the basis of hyperspectral remote sensing, and more detailed analysis of the spectral characteristics of HM is still lacking; therefore, we measured the reflection spectral curve of HM samples in the area of Jiezechaka by ASD FieldSpec4 short-wave infrared spectrometer and determined the mineral composition and content of HM samples by X-ray diffraction. The analysis indicated three and seven absorption valleys with high and low absorption intensities, respectively, in the reflectance spectral curves of the HM samples in the Jiezechaka area. Then, on this basis, the Landsat8 OLI multispectral data and ZY1-02D AHSI hyperspectral data were used as the basic data of remote sensing inversion. As the ZY1-02D AHSI data have 166 bands, which is much more than Landsat8 OLI data, it has a stronger ability to characterize the spectral characteristics of HM and can better meet the requirements of remote sensing inversion. The end member spectra were selected based on PPI and SMACC methods, respectively. The HM information around Jiezechaka Salt Lake in Tibet was extracted by the mixture tuned matched filtering method, and the regional distribution map of HM was made. A confusion matrix operation was used to compare the determination results of the two types of data. Among them, based on Landsat8 data, PPI method was used to obtain end members, and the overall accuracy of HM extraction results was > 69%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.688. Based on Landsat8 data, SMACC method was used to obtain end members, and the overall accuracy of HM extraction results was > 67%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.667. Based on ZY1-02D AHSI data, PPI method was used to obtain end members, and the overall accuracy of HM extraction results was > 76%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.743. Based on ZY1-02D AHSI data, SMACC method was used to obtain end members, and the overall accuracy of HM extraction results was > 73%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.728. It shows that the end members selected by PPI method can better express HM information in the image. Finally, through the overlay analysis of the four results, we concluded that HM outcrops in the Jiezechaka area are mainly distributed in the northwestern and southeastern regions of the lake. This study provides a rapid assessment technique for measuring HM information from salt lakes."

    "title": "Chemical weathering and carbon dioxide consumption in a small tropical river catchment, southwestern India",
    "abstract": "Studies done on small tropical west-flowing river catchments located in the Western Ghats in southwestern India have suggested very intense chemical weathering rates and associated CO 2 consumption. Very less studies are reported from these catchments notwithstanding their importance as potential sinks of atmospheric CO 2 at the global scale. A total of 156 samples were collected from a small river catchment in the southwestern India, the Payaswini–Chandragiri river Basin, during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in 2016 and 2017, respectively. This river system comprises two small rivers originating at an elevation of 1350 m in the Western Ghats in peninsular India. The catchment area is dominated by biotite sillimanite gneiss. Sodium is the dominant cation, contributing ~ 50% of the total cations, whereas HCO 3 − contributes ~ 75% of total anions. The average anion concentration in the samples varied in the range HCO 3 − > Cl − > SO 4 2− > NO 3 − > F − , whereas major cation concentration varied in the range Na + > Ca 2+ > Mg 2+ > K + . The average silicate weathering rate (SWR) was 42 t km −2 y −1 in the year 2016 and 36 t km −2 y −1 in 2017. The average annual carbon dioxide consumption rate (CCR) due to silicate rock weathering was 9.6 × 10 5 mol km −2 y −1 and 8.3 × 10 5 mol km −2 y −1 for 2016 and 2017, respectively. The CCR in the study area is higher than other large tropical river catchments like Amazon, Congo-Zaire, Orinoco, Parana and Indus because of its unique topography, hot and humid climate and intense rainfall."

    "abstract": "The Aral Sea is well known throughout the World as an inland lake disappearing due to unsustainable use of natural water resources for economic purposes. The degradation of the sea led to irreversible transformations of the ecosystem in the region and other destructive consequences. It has become a natural laboratory, allowing the study of the morphometric transformation of the properties of its waters under the influence of environmental conditions. This article is devoted to the study of temporal variability in the biogeochemical and physical characteristics with an emphasis on the metamorphosis of the ionic composition of the Aral waters and its individual water bodies (i.e., the Large and Small Aral Seas, Lakes Chernyshev and Tshchebas) in the period 1873 − 2022 based on newly obtained (2021 and 2022) and literature data. Periods of hydrochemical evolution are identified reflecting the order of salt deposition lasting for several years. The latest of these periods lasted from 2014 to 2022 waters in the salinity range of 126˗244 ‰. It was characterized by the \\({\\text{SO}}_{4}^{2-}\\) /Clˉ ratio of 0.31, while Mg 2 ⁺/Na + 0.34 and Ca 2 ⁺/Na + 0.02. Migration curves for the Aral Sea's water reflect the influence of a number of regional features on the formation of the ion-salt composition of waters was constructed. The biogeochemical features of the final stage of the Aral Sea are discussed using the example of the former bay and now lake Chernyshev. Its salinity of ~ 243 ‰ and the microbial community inhabiting it, along with the ionic composition, determines the properties of its waters."

    "title": "A Study on Ikaite Growth in the Presence of Phosphate",
    "abstract": "Phosphate is a common component in natural growth solutions of ikaite. Although phosphate often occurs as a minor constituent, its presence may promote the formation of ikaite as it significantly inhibits the precipitation of calcite. The interactions of phosphate with ikaite and the role of a potential uptake of phosphate by ikaite, however, are poorly understood. In this study, the influence of phosphate on ikaite growth at 1 °C was investigated. Ikaite- and calcite-seeded growth experiments were conducted in cryo-mixed-flow reactors at saturation ratios 1.5 ≤ Ω ikaite ≤ 2.9 ( Ω = ionic activity product/solubility product). From these growth experiments, the rate constant k = 0.10 ± 0.03 µmol/m 2 /s and the reaction order n = 0.8 ± 0.3 were derived for ikaite. The reaction order implies a transport- or adsorption-controlled growth mechanism which supports a low energy pathway of ikaite growth via an attachment of hydrous CaCO 3 0 complexes without any extensive dehydration of aqueous species as, for instance, required for calcite growth. A potential depletion of aqueous phosphate due to an uptake by ikaite growth was not detectable. Furthermore, growth retardation by phosphate, as known for calcite growth, was not evident. Thus, a significant incorporation of phosphate into growing ikaite could be precluded for the conditions applied in this study. The observed lack of incorporation of phosphate agrees with the previously suggested growth mechanism via the attachment of hydrous CaCO 3 0 complexes which likely does not facilitate substantial substitution of carbonate by phosphate ions."

    "title": "Concentration of Iron(II) in Fresh Groundwater Controlled by Siderite, Field Evidence",
    "abstract": "Iron(II) concentrations in fresh groundwater in Dutch aquifers range from absent up to 50 mg/l. Evaluation of extensive chemical data sets learned that the maximum logarithmic concentration of iron(II) in aquifers, between ± 6.5 < pH < ± 8, is a linear function of pH, governed by Siderite. It is a broad relation due to oversaturation with respect to Siderite and to variation in alkalinity. Iron(II) is continuously supplied to groundwater by reduction of hydrous ferric oxides (HFO), until becoming saturated with respect to Siderite, and from then on, HFO reduction and Siderite precipitation occur simultaneously. In Dutch aquifers, the electron supply rate (equivalent to the organic matter oxidation rate) apparently exceeds the HFO electron uptake rate (equivalent to the HFO reduction rate) and the excess supply is taken up by sulfate (equivalent to the sulfate reduction rate): HFO reduction, sulfate reduction and FeS precipitation occurring simultaneously, where the presence of Siderite prevents a dip in the iron(II) concentration. After sulfate becomes exhausted, the excess electron supply is transferred to methane production: HFO reduction and methane production occurring simultaneously. This evaluation also demonstrated that the organic matter oxidation rate and the HFO reduction rate decrease over time. The results of this study are also relevant for the behavior of As and of Co, Ni and Zn in groundwater, as HFO, Pyrite and Siderite may contain variable contents of these elements."

    "abstract": "Spring waters with high-pCO 2 content are widely distributed in the Sikhote-Alin region in Russia. Mukhen spa is one such spring located in the northern Sikhote-Alin region. This spa has two types of upwelling spring waters and exhibits distinct chemical signatures. One of the springs originates from a shallow aquifer and features hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios of meteoric water with a high 3 He/ 4 He ratio, whereas the other originates from a deeper aquifer and features a distinctly negative δ 18 O with a lower 3 He/ 4 He ratio. To understand this apparent discrepancy and the water circulation dynamics beneath Mukhen springs, we utilized all published data concerning the major solute elements and isotopic ratios of Mukhen spring waters and compared them with the He isotopic compositions on several springs in the far eastern region, which are newly analyzed in this study. The results show that the shallow aquifer comprises meteoric water that interacts with the crust enhanced by the gas component welling up from deep underground, while the fluid in deep aquifer fingerprinted the hydration reaction of silicate and involves a mantle component possibly delivered by a deep-seated fluid and/or gas upwelling along the tectonic fault through the western margin of the Sikhote-Alin region."

    "title": "Hydrogeochemical Processes of the Azigza Lake System (Middle Atlas, Morocco) Inferred from Monthly Monitoring",
    "abstract": "The High Oum-Er-Rbia basin, located in the Moroccan Middle Atlas, is a karstic region with significant water sources that have essential functions regarding agriculture, hydropower production, industrial and drinking water. The region contains abundant wetlands, especially springs, rivers and natural lakes. These systems are highly sensitive to the effects of climate change, experiencing considerable lake level, water chemistry, and biological fluctuations in response to regional hydrological balances. This study focuses on the hydrogeochemical processes and mechanisms that control the chemical composition and variability of Azigza Lake, a typical tectono-karstic lake system of the region. Water monitoring was implemented from July 2013 to October 2014 with a monthly water sampling for physicochemical measurements and major ion concentration analyses of lake water and the surrounding groundwater. Both waters show a relatively low salinity due to the fresh input from the Lower Jurassic karst formation. Lake waters are slightly alkaline and of the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type. The geochemistry of the lake waters is mainly controlled by carbonate weathering through water–rock interaction and, to a lesser extent, by cation exchange and precipitation of carbonate minerals. The hydrochemistry of the lake showed clear responses to seasonal changes in precipitation and evaporation, with higher conductivity during the wet period. During the beginning of the wet season, groundwater evolution could be explained by a simple first flush stormwater. The rapid response of lake water to subsurface and underground waters confirms the dominance of an underground conduct flow regime. These changes and behaviors highlight the sensitivity of Azigza system to regional hydrological and climatic changes."

    "title": "Assessing Silicate Catchment Dynamics of the Oplotnica River (Slovenia) Through Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopes",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the sources of carbon and nitrogen in a small, silicate-dominated catchment (Oplotnica River, Pohorje, Slovenia) with two creeks, Lukanjski and Javorski, from 2012 to 2014. Additionally, carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil profiles was studied at Javorski Creek. Isotopic analyses of river water, particulates, and sediments provided a more holistic view of the sources of carbon and nitrogen, weathering contributions, and the evasion or sequestration of CO 2 in the atmosphere within the catchments. The weathering of rocks, such as granodiorite and quartz diorite, influences water geochemistry. The Oplotnica River and its tributaries were characterized by the ion composition: Na + > Ca 2+ > Mg 2+ > K + and HCO 3 − > SO 4 2− > Cl − > NO 3 − . Partial pressure of CO 2 concentrations in river and creeks ranged from 1.1 to 13.4 times that of atmospheric pressure, representing a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The carbon isotope value of dissolved inorganic carbon ( δ 13 C DIC ) ranged from − 9.8 to − 1.4‰ in river, while in the creeks, it ranged from − 26.1 to − 4.7‰, reflecting the degradation of organic matter and exchange with the atmosphere. The intensity of bicarbonate weathering for the Oplotnica River at its gauging station was 10.4 mmol/(l⋅km 2 ⋅s), characteristic of silicate watersheds. The isotopic composition of carbon ( δ 13 C) and nitrogen ( δ 15 N) in river sediments reflects values typical of soil and temperate (C3) plants. This study is significant on both local and global levels, as it addresses the contribution of weathering rates and the release of CO 2 to the atmosphere from small silicate watersheds."

    "title": "Influence of Diverse Urban Pressures on Water Characteristics in a Small Eastern Mediterranean Watershed",
    "abstract": "This work focuses on the characterization of a typical coastal karst watershed by addressing its physico-chemical parameters. The concentrations of the main ions clearly indicate the dominance of Ca 2+ and HCO 3 − with a carbonate weathering rate equivalent to 230t/Km 2 /year; that is a typical weathering of karst watersheds. The spatio-temporal variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is also assessed in the watershed. Many samples were collected under different hydrological conditions from three representative sites. The evolution of OM composition along an urbanization gradient from upstream to downstream Kadisha watershed reveals the very strong impact of urban discharges on the receiving waters. Substantial differences in DOC results are highlighted in relation to the urban or natural origin of the DOM. Upstream OM flux is quantified and compared to downstream OM flux showing that, during the low flow period, the downstream flux is 29 times higher than the upstream. Also, a large fraction of non-humic substances, including hydrophilic organic matter HPI, is detected in the downstream section impacted by urban discharges. The higher values of SUVA noticed for DOM at upstream compared to downstream, reflects the low aromaticity and non-humic character of DOM in downstream. These outcomes show the impact of the Tripoli urban discharges on the quality and quantity of OM in the receiving waters downstream of the Kadisha catchment. This is typical at low water period when the dilution factor of urban discharges in the receiving waters is the least."

    "abstract": "Equilibrium-kinetic modeling allows investigating metal behavior in the water–rock-organic matter system with time to evaluate anthropogenic effects on the environment. In the article, the interactions of stagnant mine drainage water of the flooded mine “Arsenic” with ore and gangue minerals were simulated using different organic matter incorporation approaches. If the model is closed to humic substances (no additional organic matter input), most fulvic acids are bound in the Fe fulvate complex. While under the removal of Fe fulvate from the model, the Cu fulvate becomes prevalent, the contribution of the fulvate complexes with Zn, Mg, and Ca also increases. This scenario simulates the organo-mineral complexes behavior well and allows identifying the sequence of metal binding to organic ligands as follows Fe > Cu > Zn > Mg > Ca. The second scenario imitates the constant input of organic matter to the model (open system regarding humic substances). The dissolved metal concentrations in the model solution are extremely high in comparison to the mine drainage water. This scenario demonstrates that excessive input of organic matter leads to the accumulation of the metals in a dissolved form and blocks the secondary mineral formation despite the faster dissolution of the primary minerals under a more acidic pH than in the first scenario. However, despite the differences between the model solution and the mine drainage water, this scenario is useful to address specific issues associated with changes in natural and anthropogenic conditions. Both scenarios show the importance of organic matter incorporation to the equilibrium-kinetic models."

    "title": "Temporal and Spatial Variabilities of Chemical and Physical Parameters on the Heron Island Coral Reef Platform",
    "abstract": "Globally, coral reefs are threatened by ocean warming and acidification. The degree to which acidification will impact reefs is dependent on the local hydrodynamics, benthic community composition, and biogeochemical processes, all of which vary on different temporal and spatial scales. Characterizing the natural spatiotemporal variability of seawater carbonate chemistry across different reefs is critical for elucidating future impacts on coral reefs. To date, most studies have focused on select habitats, whereas fewer studies have focused on reef scale variability. Here, we investigate the temporal and spatial seawater physicochemical variability across the entire Heron Island coral reef platform, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, for a limited duration of six days. Autonomous sensor measurements at three sites across the platform were complemented by reef-wide boat surveys and discrete sampling of seawater carbonate chemistry during the morning and evening. Variability in both temporal and spatial physicochemical properties were predominantly driven by solar irradiance (and its effect on biological activity) and the semidiurnal tidal cycles but were influenced by the local geomorphology resulting in isolation of the platform during low tide and rapid flooding during rising tides. As a result, seawater from previous tidal cycles was sometimes trapped in different parts of the reef leading to unexpected biogeochemical trends in space and time. This study illustrates the differences and limitations of data obtained from high-frequency measurements in a few locations compared to low-frequency measurements at high spatial resolution and coverage, showing the need for a combined approach to develop predictive capability of seawater physicochemical properties on coral reefs."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a new 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isoscape map of Central and NE Germany. This area is characterized by an alternation of sedimentary basins and mountainous regions with a very variable lithology. Since lithology and rock age have a major impact on the isotopic composition of biologically available strontium, Central and NE Germany should reveal highly variable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. From lithological characteristics, particularly high ratios are expected in the mountainous regions of the Erzgebirge/Fichtelgebirge and the Harz Mountains. In contrast to these predictions, published 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isoscape maps of Central and NE Germany record rather uniform and low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. From this observation, we suspected that existing isoscape maps might be computed from an insufficient database, with mountainous regions being underrepresented. Our goal was to gather 87 Sr/ 86 Sr baselines for each major lithology of Central and NE Germany and to produce an accurate isoscape map of Central and NE Germany. In the first step, we evaluated the suitability of stream water and groundwater as a proxy for biologically available strontium. In a selected watershed, we present mixing relationships and a stream network model. We show that groundwater is prone to very local geologic and anthropogenic influences and should thus be avoided. Instead, we focussed our further sampling on stream water. Altogether, we used 119 new measurements of groundwater and stream water and a set of 23 auxiliary variables as a database for our new isoscape map of Central and NE Germany. Due to a sampling strategy that focussed on covering each major lithology, our measurements and the final isoscape map show a clear contrast between sedimentary basins and mountainous regions. For regions that have been sufficiently sampled, a direct comparison of the isoscape map with published and new data shows good agreement. Although Central and NE Germany were part of published isoscape maps, our new map is the first that predicts 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in mountainous regions with high accuracy."

    "title": "Solute Sources and Mechanism of Boron Enrichment in the Tataleng River on the Northern Margin of the Qaidam Basin",
    "abstract": "The Tataleng River (TTR), as an important tributary of the Da Qaidam Salt Lake (DQSL) and Xiao Qaidam Salt Lake (XQSL) in the Qaidam Basin (QB), has an exceptionally high B content. However, the solute sources and the provenance of B in the TTR are still unclear, which significantly hinders a deeper understanding of the source–sink processes of the boron deposits in the QB. In this study, water samples were collected from tributaries, mainstreams, mud volcanoes, hot springs, and rainwater in the TTR area. Through hydrochemical analysis, forward modeling, and B isotope geochemistry methods, combined with the previous research results, some findings were obtained. The hydrochemical type of TTR is Ca–Mg–Cl, and the major mechanism of controlling chemical composition is rock weathering. The solute sources in the TTR are mainly from dissolution of evaporites (75.9%), atmospheric precipitation (20.8%), and a minor contribution from carbonates (3.1%) and silicates weathering (0.6%). The higher B content (0.89–4.30 mg/L, mean = 2.13 mg/L) and lower δ 11 B value (0.79‰–4.71‰, mean = 4.17‰) of the TTR indicate that the B sources are mainly from mixture of mud volcanic waters (56.19–199.98 mg/L, mean = 113.51 mg/L, − 1.26‰–2.22‰, mean = 0.85‰) in the upper reaches, and the deep groundwater near the Indosinian granite in the lower reaches. The significant difference in boron resources between the two lakes may be due to the enrichment of B in the late Pleistocene in the DQSL, which received exceptionally rich soluble B carried by the ancient TTR during an active tectonic period, while the weakening of tectonic activity and the diversion of the ancient TTR resulted in the supply of B with significantly reduced content to the XQSL. These results are helpful for a deeper understanding of the ore-forming mechanisms of the boron deposits in salt lake."

    "abstract": "As renewable energy, geothermal can contribute substantially to the energy transition. To generate electricity or to harvest heat, high-saline fluids are tapped by wells of a few kilometres and extracted from hydrothermal reservoirs. After the heat exchanger units have been passed by, these fluids are reinjected into the reservoir. Due to the pressure and temperature differences between the subsurface and the surface, as well as the cooling of the fluids in the power plant, unwanted chemical reactions can occur within the reservoir, in the borehole, and within the power plant itself. This can reduce the permeability of the reservoir as well as the output of the geothermal power plant. This study aims to simulate real subsurface reactions using batch and leaching experiments with sandstone or sandstone powder as solid phase, and deionised water or natural brine as liquid phase. It is demonstrated that fluid composition changes after only a few days. In particular, calcite, aragonite, clay minerals, and zinc phases precipitate from the natural brine. In contrast, in particular minerals containing potassium, arsenic, barium, and silica are dissolved. Due to the experimental set-up, these mineral reactions mainly took place on the surface of the samples, which is why no substantial changes in petrophysical properties could be observed. However, it is assumed that the observed reactions on the reservoir scale have a relevant influence on parameters such as permeability."

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Variations of Riverine CO2 Partial Pressure and its Effect on CO2 Flux at the Water–Air Interface in a Small Karst River",
    "abstract": "In the global carbon cycle, rivers are the main transport channel for terrestrial carbon sources into the ocean, and their CO 2 fluxes at the water–air interface affect the carbon budget. As an important component of the carbon cycle in the terrestrial ecosystem, karst regions exhibit carbon source and sink effects due to their special environmental conditions. To elaborate the spatial and temporal distribution of CO 2 fluxes at the water–air interface of karst rivers and the influencing factors, systematic monitoring of small karst rivers in southwest China was conducted between November and December 2019 and between June and July 2020, respectively. The results show that: (1) the water chemistry of Chiwuxi River belonged to the HCO 3 –Ca–Mg type, and Ca 2+ and HCO 3 − temporally showed a larger concentration in the dry season than in the wet season. (2) CO 2 partial pressure ( p CO 2 ) and CO 2 fluxes showed a seasonal characteristic of higher values in the wet season than in the dry season. p CO 2 ranged from 323.59 to 1380.38 μatm and CO 2 fluxes ranged from −24.31 to 353.74 mmol (m 2 d) −1 . During the wet season, the Chiwuxi River showed a carbon source effect. During the dry season, the photosynthesis of aquatic plants reduced CO 2 outgassing. (3) Isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 C DIC ) showed a higher value in the dry season than in the wet season. The dissolved inorganic carbon mainly originated from soil CO 2 and carbonate weathering. To improve the understanding of riverine carbon cycling, it is necessary to study CO 2 fluxes at the water–air interface of small rivers in the karst region. Thus, this will help to reduce the uncertainty of CO 2 fluxes in global rivers."

    "abstract": "Estuarine total alkalinity (TA), which buffers against acidification, is temporally and spatially variable and regulated by complex, interacting hydrologic and biogeochemical processes. During periods of net evaporation (drought), the Mission-Aransas Estuary (MAE) of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico experienced TA losses beyond what can be attributed to calcification. The contribution of sedimentary oxidation of reduced sulfur to the TA loss was examined in this study. Water column samples were collected from five stations within MAE and analyzed for salinity, TA, and calcium ion concentrations. Sediment samples from four of these monitoring stations and one additional station within MAE were collected and incubated between 2018 and 2021. TA, calcium, magnesium, and sulfate ion concentrations were analyzed for these incubations. Production of sulfate along with TA consumption (or production) beyond what can be attributed to calcification (or carbonate dissolution) was observed. These results suggest that oxidation of reduced sulfur consumed TA in MAE during droughts. We estimate that the upper limit of TA consumption due to reduced sulfur oxidation can be as much as 4.60 × 10 8 mol day −1 in MAE. This biogeochemical TA sink may be present in other similar subtropical, freshwater-starved estuaries around the world."

    "title": "Origin and Formation Mechanisms of Potassium- and Lithium-Rich Brines in the Triassic Strata of Northeastern Sichuan Basin, South China",
    "abstract": "The northeastern Sichuan Basin hosts deep brines with unusually high concentrations of potassium (K) and lithium (Li). This study examines deep brines abundant in K and Li in northeastern Sichuan Basin. Brine samples from Well ZK601 underwent comprehensive analysis for major elements, trace elements, and Sr isotopes. Lithium content in core samples correlated with regional brine reservoir features. Brine samples showed a salinity range of 354.6–363 g/L, with varying contents of Na + (101–106 g/L), K + (28.92–34.84 g/L), Cl − (202.1–206 g/L), Br − (2110–2980 mg/L), and Li + (169.5–204.5 mg/L). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in brine was 0.708324. Li notably increased post-green bean rock deposition in 71 core samples. The ratios are as follows: Br × 10 3 /Cl is 10.24, K × 10 3 /Cl is 169.13, nNa/nCl is 0.74, and SO 4 × 10 3 /Cl is 0.49. These brines likely originated from ancient seawater, evolving via rock interactions during burial, notably enriching K and Li through gypsum dehydration. Geochemical traits and Sr isotopes affirm ancient seawater origin, stressing continual water–rock interactions. The volcanic activity contributed significantly to lithium enrichment, consolidated during later burial stages. Brine reservoirs, mostly in formations like dolomite within the Jialingjiang Formation, associate closely with fractured zones. Structural traps define distribution, while fault systems govern enrichment. Accumulation mainly occurs in fractured zones, reflecting a mineralization model of seawater origins, metamorphism, filtration, and structural enrichment. In summary, our model outlines a transformation from seawater origins to structural controls enriching K and Li in deep brines in northeastern Sichuan Basin."

    "title": "Source and Formation of Boron Deposits in Mahai Basin on the Northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: Clues from Hydrochemistry and Boron Isotopes",
    "abstract": "There are typical salt lake-type borate deposits in the northern Qaidam Basin, which are mainly distributed in Da Qaidam Lake (DQL), Xiao Qaidam Lake, and Mahai Basin (MHB). DQL has deposited famous solid borates and enriched a large number of brine boron deposits. It is the earliest industrial production base in China. Nanbaxian (NBX) to the west of DQL is a unique area where solid borates are deposited in MHB. Although there are three salt lakes in the MHB, borate deposits were only deposited in the salt pits of NBX, and the formation process of these borate deposits remains to be clarified. In this study, the major elements, boron contents, and d 11 B values in the water and sediments of NBX were investigated in conjunction with the B-Na-Mg equivalence diagrams and relevant data from other salt lakes to elucidate the source of boron in MHB and the depositional conditions of borate minerals in NBX. The results are as follows: (1) The source of boron in NBX differs from that in three salt lakes in MHB. The source in NBX is mainly constrained by the weathering and fluid-rock (Boron-bearing ultra-high pressure metamorphic belt) interaction, while that in Dezongmahai and Niulangzhinv–Balunmahai lakes are primarily controlled by river water and anticlinal brine, respectively. (2) The high boron content (0.28 to 41.38 mg/L) and low d 11 B values (- 34.71‰ to - 6.14‰) of the water-soluble phase of sediments in NBX are consistent with geochemical characteristics (d 11 B: - 23.67‰ to - 3.0‰) of borates in DQL, demonstrating that the re-dissolution of borate deposits in NBX. (3) Deposition of borate minerals in the MHB requires ionic equivalents of Mg, Na, and B to 0.02 to 0.4, 0.25 to 0.75, and 0.2 to 0.7, respectively. Additionally, the brine hydrochemistry in which the borate are deposited must be of the carbonate or sulfate type, and the brine water should be greater than 8 in pH and 400 mg/L in boron content. This study provides a theoretical basis for exploring and exploiting salt lake-type borate deposits."

    "title": "Contribution of Hydrothermal Processes to the Enrichment of Lithium in Brines: Evidence from Water–Rock Interacting Experiments",
    "abstract": "Over the world, the available lithium (Li) resources are reserved mainly in closed-basin brines, with high Li concentration (> 150 mg/L) and low Mg/Li ratio (< 10) being critical for Li extraction using precipitation-based methods. In order to investigate the enrichment of Li over Mg during the formation of Li brine deposits, batch water–rock interacting experiments between igneous rocks and aqueous solutions were carried out under low (25, 50 and 75 °C) and high (200, 300 and 400 °C) temperature conditions. Our results show that for the experiments using water and accomplished under 25 °C, the Mg and Li concentrations vary from 0.470 and 0.782 mg/L in the solution interacted with Li-rich granite, to 5.626 and < 0.002 mg/L in that interacted with basalt, with Mg/Li ratio being slightly higher than those of the igneous rocks. By contrast, while a NaCl or Na 2 SO 4 solution was used, the Mg and Li concentrations can be improved by up to tens of times, and the Mg/Li ratio also increased slightly. Lastly and above all, with increase in the water–rock interacting temperature from 25 to 400 °C, the Mg and Li concentrations in all solutions vary conversely and the Mg/Li ratio decreases by orders of magnitude, leading to the formation of Li-rich brines with very low Mg/Li ratios at temperatures above 200 °C. By comparing the results from our experiment to those from Li-rich springs, rivers and closed-basin brines, we conclude that water evaporation over time is fundamental for the concentration of Li in brines, meanwhile high-temperature hydrothermal processes are key to the formation of Li brine deposits with low Mg/Li ratios."

    "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most active organic component in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, 165 soil samples which were dominated by moss were collected from grasslands with similar vegetation in urban residential areas from 55 cities across different climatic zones of China. The water extractable organic matter (WEOM) of samples was analyzed. The results showed that WEOM content ranged from 23.5 to 517.6 mg kg −1 in the soil samples. Four fluorescent components including two tryptophan-like components (C1 and C4) and two humic-like components (C2 and C3) were identified by excitation–emission matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). Proportions of humic-like components (C2 + C3) were 54–66%, which is 1.2–2.0 times of the tryptophan-like component proportion (C1 + C4) for all samples. The proportions of C2 and C3 were highest in the tropical monsoon climate (TroM) zone compared to that in the other climatic zones. Structural equation model and decomposition of variation showed that soil nutrient content was the main contributing factor of soil WEOM. Content Total nitrogen content and mean annual temperature (MAT) were the main factors influencing soil HIX but they had the opposite effects. Our results suggested that increasing soil nutrient content contributed the increase in soil WEOM content, but increasing MAT reduced the humification degree of WEOM."

    "title": "Occurrence, Chemical, and Pb-isotopic Composition of Uraninite: A Verification of the Effective Source of Uranium in a Granite Aquifer of the Daejeon Area, South Korea",
    "abstract": "Daejeon is well-known in South Korea for having the highest concentrations of uranium in the Jurassic granite aquifer. This study reports the texture and chemistry of uraninite and discusses the potential of uraninite as an effective source mineral of U in granite aquifers based on uraninite dissolution and U-migration. Its texture and mineral chemistry were examined using FE-SEM and EPMA, respectively, to investigate the occurrence of uraninite. The Pb isotope ratios of the minerals in granite were tested to verify their potential as geochemical tracers for elemental migration. The Pb isotope ratios were obtained using a SHRIMP IIe/MC ion microprobe. Uraninite occurred with muscovite and pyrite as large grains of up to 500 μm in length in the altered granite. Coffinite, a secondary U-mineral, occurs in the cracks within uraninite. The uraninite U content ranged from 79.12 to 89.05 wt. % and uraninites have major impurities of Th, and Pb ranged from 1.82 to 3.49 and 2.13 to 2.42 wt. %, respectively. The breakdown of uraninite may result in the redistribution of U and Pb and facilitate U-migration during surface weathering. The Eh–pH conditions of groundwater are suitable for the dissolution of uraninite, and the uranyl carbonate complex ion (UO 2 (CO 3 ) 2 2− ) is the dominant U-species in the study area. The Pb isotope ratios indicated that uraninite contained radiogenic Pb, feldspar contained common Pb, and pyrite contained a mixture of both components. These Pb isotopic signatures indicate that the radiogenic Pb in uraninite has migrated from uraninite to pyrite. Considering the relatively high mobility of U compared to Pb, the migration of radiogenic Pb from uraninite to pyrite suggests that U can also migrate from uraninite to its surroundings when a reaction with groundwater occurs. Based on hydrological conditions and the Pb isotope signature, uraninite is considered a substantial and compelling host mineral for interpreting a source of uranium in the granite aquifer of the study area."

    "abstract": "Brine groundwater in Quaternary salt lakes is widely exploited to extract potassium, lithium, and boron; the complex hydrogeological parameters of brine aquifers could cause significant difficulties in brine resource assessment and exploitation. However, the origin and porosity of brine aquifers remain unclear. This study presents an approach that utilizes geochemical indicator analysis with paleogeographic reconstruction to better assess porosity in salt lake aquifers. We identified 15 representative boreholes in Mahai Salt Lake, and the lithology, porosity, and chloride contents of their respective sediments, the pore porosity of each borehole in the study area ranges from 38.17 to 0.51%, the average chloride content of each borehole ranges from 26.63 to 38.74%, found that the vertical porosity fluctuations of halite deposits were significantly larger than those of detrital deposits, the sediments in the boreholes consisted predominantly of halite-containing debris or fine-debris-containing halite, reflecting the paleoenvironmental signatures of the salt lake. According to lithology and sedimentary environment, four brine aquifers were classified and the chloride and porosity distribution characteristics in the I–IV brine aquifers were further illustrated. Based on information of paleolake evolution in Qaidam Basin, we established a conceptual model to identify the impact factors for the porosity distribution pattern in the I–IV brine aquifers."

    "abstract": "This study investigated weathering and hydrobiogeochemical processes in a silicate dominated watershed (Svratka river) in the Czech Republic in comparison with nearby carbonate dominated catchments. Elemental and isotopic analysis of river waters, particulates and sediments provided a more holistic view of weathering contributions, anthropogenic contamination, biological activity and evasion or sinks of CO 2 to the atmosphere. In water samples, we determined total alkalinity after Gran 1974, and cations and anions were determined with inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer and ion chromatograph. δ 13 C DIC in water samples was determined with isotope ratio mass spectrometer. pCO 2 and saturation indexes of calcite and dolomite were calculated with PHREEQC speciation program. Evasion fluxes were calculated after Broecker, 1974. Isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen in particulate matter and sediments were determined with isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Mineral composition of sediments was determined with XRD method and elements with XRF method. Further enrichment factors of elements were calculated. The Svratka river, which is the major tributary of the Dyje river, is dominated by Ca 2+ > Na + > Mg 2+ > K + and HCO 3 − (as total alkalinity). Partial pressure (pCO 2 ) concentrations range from close to 0–572-fold of atmospheric pressure. Isotopic composition of carbon in dissolved inorganic carbon ( δ 13 C DIC ) value ranged from − 13.3 to − 8.0‰ reflecting degradation of organic matter and exchange with the atmosphere. Bicarbonate weathering intensity for the Svratka river at its mouth is 11.8 mol/(l⋅km 2 ⋅s), more on par with silicate terrains and lower than nearby carbonate watersheds. Isotopic composition of carbon ( δ 13 C) and isotopic composition of nitrogen ( δ 15 N) values of river sediment reflect soil and temperate plant (C3 plant) values, while higher δ 15 N values could be attributed to application of organic fertilizers in lower reaches. The river sediments, which came from weathering of crystalline rocks, are dominated by silt size, geochemically less mature quartz, feldspar and muscovite particles. All the stream sediments examined revealed slightly increased amounts of Zn, Cu and Pb. However, using Al as the normalization element to calculate enrichment factors, Zn, Cu and Pb are only elevated downstream, related to industrial contamination. This study is important for local and global level since it deals with contribution of weathering rates and contribution of CO 2 to the atmosphere in silicate watershed."

In the present study, the sorption behaviour of 133 Ba(II), one of the high-yield fission products of uranium-based fuels and analogue of 90 Sr ( t 1/2 = 28.5 y), on Fe(II)–Mt and Fe(III)–Mt has been investigated. Retention behavior of Ba(II) on Fe–Mt has been studied at varying pH (3–9), ionic strength (0.001 M–1 M) and Ba(II) concentration (10 −9 –10 −3 M) by batch sorption method. The distribution coefficient ( K d ) of Ba(II) on Fe–Mt was found to be nearly independent of pH while it decreased with increasing ionic strength indicating ion exchange as the dominant Ba(II) sorption mode on Fe–Mt. Adsorption isotherm of Ba(II) exhibited linearity in the entire Ba(II) concentration range. A comparison of Ba(II) sorption behavior on Fe–Mt and Na–Mt has been made. The Fe released from both Fe(III)–Mt and Fe(II)–Mt was measured in all the sorption experiments and was found to be much less in the case of Fe(III)–Mt (≤ 1.7 ppm) when compared to Fe(II)–Mt (~ 25 ppm). The modeling of Ba(II) sorption profiles on Fe–Mt and Na–Mt has been carried out using FITEQL 4.0."

    "abstract": "The elemental records of the sediments from two IODP cores, U1501C (Oligocene and Late Miocene-Pliocene) and U1499A (Pliocene to Pleistocene) in the Northern South China Sea have been studied here to understand the variability in the sedimentary provenance and depositional environment, which are impacted by the tectonic and East Asian monsoon evolution through time. The major oxides and REE abundances indicate the sources of sediment influx to be significantly from the South China, North and North eastern parts of SCS since ~ 33 Ma, and prominent contributions from Pearl River, Hainan Island and Taiwanese rivers since ~8.3 Ma. The depositional redox is corroborated by the Ce anomaly and trace element proxies such as U/Th, V/Cr, V/(V + Ni), and Ni/Co. The chemical weathering intensity, evidenced by the Chemical Index of Alteration and major elements (Ca/Ti, Na/Ti, Al/K, Al/Ti, AL/Na), and La/Sm ratios, was observed to be low. Early Oligocene witnessed the deposition of littoral sediments, caused by the initial rifting and spreading in SCS. During the late Miocene (~ 8.3 Ma), sedimentation was influenced by the prevailing arid climate and intensification of East Asian Winter monsoon (EAWM). Since Pliocene–Pleistocene (~ 5.3 Ma−0.01 Ma), the sediment deposition remained unaffected by tectonism, but was majorly influenced by the intensification of EAWM and the glacial-interglacial cycles."

    "abstract": "In a warming climate, land-to-water carbon mobilization is increasing in glacier and permafrost area. To identify the connection between exported river carbon content and the permafrost or glacier condition in the high-altitude mountain area, we studied the dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration in three streams of Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), which were located in the continuous permafrost, seasonal permafrost and glacial basin, respectively. It was found that the DIC and DOC concentrations were lower in the glacial rivers compared with the permafrost derived rivers; but more DOC would be exported from glacier due to the large amount of melted glacier water in the high mountainous area. DIC/DOC ratio in rivers reflected the watershed landscape types. In the permafrost area, the river recharged by seasonal permafrost had higher DIC concentration than the river in the continuous permafrost region, suggesting that increased DIC concentration could be a precursor of permafrost degradation. Research is meaningful to estimate the DOC and DIC export from high mountain area."

    "title": "Elemental Variations and Mechanisms of Brines in the Context of Large-Scale Exploitation: A Case Study of Xitaijnar Salt Lake, Qaidam Basin",
    "abstract": "There is limited research on the variations in brine element changes and the factors that influence them during large-scale exploitation. The Xitaijnar Salt Lake in the Qaidam Basin is a large brine lithium deposit. In this study, we investigated the variations in chemical composition and the factors that influence intercrystalline brine at different time periods. Hydrochemistry, mineralogy, and hydrogeochemical simulation methods were employed to understand the brine evolution. Our results indicate that after nearly 20 years of exploitation, the intercrystalline brine still belongs to the magnesium sulfate subtype, with only slight variations in salinity. The concentrations of Na, K, and SO 4 showed a slight increase, while the content of Mg and Cl decreased slightly. The concentrations of B and Li exhibited minor fluctuations. The provenance, water level, and hydraulic connection had minimal influence on the chemical composition of the intercrystalline brine. By contrast, the dynamic dissolution and precipitation of sulfate minerals and halite, as well as drastic changes in hydrological conditions (such as floods), were identified as the main factors affecting the chemical composition of brine. With the large-scale extraction of intercrystalline brine, the content of elements in the salt lake showed a decreasing trend. This can be attributed to the fact that intercrystalline brine is formed through long-term evaporation and concentration. Therefore, during the exploitation process, it is crucial to monitor the hydrochemical variations of intercrystalline brine and understand the controlling factors. The results of this study may prove useful for the sustainable development and utilization of salt lake resources worldwide."

    "abstract": "There is growing concern about the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on coral reefs, with many studies indicating decreasing calcium carbonate production and reef growth. However, to accurately predict how coral reefs will respond to OA, it is necessary to characterize natural carbonate chemistry conditions, including the spatiotemporal mean and variability and the physical and biogeochemical drivers across different environments. In this study, spatial and temporal physiochemical variability was characterized at two contrasting reef locations in Bocas del Toro, Panama, that differed in their benthic community composition, reef morphology, and exposure to open ocean conditions, using a combination of approaches including autonomous sensors and spatial surveys during November 2015. Mean and diurnal temporal variability in both physical and chemical seawater parameters were similar between sites and sampling depths, but with occasional differences in extreme values. The magnitude of spatial variability was different between the two sites, which reflected the cumulative effect from terrestrial runoff and benthic metabolism. Based on graphical vector analysis of TA–DIC data, reef metabolism was dominated by organic over inorganic carbon cycling at both sites, with net heterotrophy and net calcium carbonate dissolution dominating the majority of observations. The results also highlight the potentially strong influence of terrestrial freshwater runoff on surface seawater conditions, and the challenges associated with evaluating and characterizing this influence on benthic habitats. The Bocas del Toro reef is a unique system that deserves attention to better understand the mechanisms that allow corals and coral reefs to persist under increasingly challenging environmental conditions."

    "title": "Modeling Impacts of Fe Activity and H2 Partial Pressure on Hydrogen Storage in Shallow Subsurface Reservoirs",
    "abstract": "Advancing underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is essential for a sustainable, emission-free future, with its success highly contingent on the unique properties of each subsurface reservoir. To ensure optimal storage, detailed site assessments are required. One of the critical gaps in knowledge necessary for ensuring safe storage is geochemical redox reactions, especially those involving iron. These redox reactions are crucial as they influence hydrogen retention or loss in the subsurface environments. In this study, we have theoretically addressed hydrogen consumption via abiotic reduction of a Fe 3+ oxide under different Fe 2+ activities. Simulations indicate that in scenarios, where the initial hydrogen partial pressure is extremely low (around 10 −5 bars), decreasing the activity of Fe 2+ by a factor of 10 can lead to a marked decrease in the initial hydrogen pressure by a maximum factor of 1000 within a few years. Variations in Fe 2+ activity can significantly influence abiotic hydrogen consumption only under very low hydrogen partial pressures. This is primarily due to enhanced dissolution of Fe 3+ oxides. In comparison, in conditions where hydrogen partial pressure is higher (> 10 −2 bars), reduction of Fe 3+ oxide can yield magnetite, resulting in a muted loss of hydrogen over time. The transition in the reduction behavior of Fe 3+ oxide from a ‘dissolution-driven’ process to ‘magnetite crystallization,’ which also determines the fate of stored hydrogen, depends on initial hydrogen partial pressure. Our results demonstrate that low quantities of hydrogen can be maintained within typical storage cycles spanning less than a year, depending upon aqueous Fe content."

    "abstract": "Soil quality (SQ) is crucial for sustaining agricultural productivity, environmental health, and human well-being. Evaluating SQ involves analyzing soil properties and their spatial distribution. Utilization of geographic information systems (GIS) helps in understanding soil heterogeneity and provides a robust framework for SQ monitoring. This study focuses on the state of Mizoram, Northeast India, characterized by its hilly terrain, high rainfall, and diverse forest types. Soil samples were collected from 103 points across 11 districts, representing four different forest types, to assess SQ variability throughout the state using various physical, chemical, and biological parameters. Key soil parameters, including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture content, bulk density (BD), available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), and dehydrogenase activity (DHA), were measured. The GMA was employed to integrate these parameters into a comprehensive Soil Quality Index (SQI). The GIS-based spatial modeling facilitated the creation of detailed SQ maps with 84% overall accuracy, revealing significant variability in soil properties across the region. The SQ was classified into five grades, with grade III being the most extensive, covering 40.75% of Mizoram. Notably, the Assam subtropical pine forests exhibited overall higher soil quality compared to other forest types. This study emphasizes the critical role of GIS-based spatial analysis in capturing soil heterogeneity and developing an effective framework for SQ monitoring. The results provide valuable insights for land management and sustainable agricultural practices, aiding efforts to maintain soil health and improve productivity in Mizoram."

    "abstract": "The Neogene sedimentary successions in peninsular India remain poorly understood due to limited surface exposures. Recent infrastructural developments in northern Kerala, especially around Kasargod, have enabled detailed investigations of the Cheruvathur Formation, a stratigraphic equivalent of the Neogene Warkalli Formation. Multiple sedimentary sections were studied using granulometry, SEM, XRD, XRF, and ICP-MS techniques. The sediments are predominantly silty, with lesser amounts of gravel, sand, and clay, and show poor to moderate sorting with near-symmetrical grain distributions. Mineralogical data highlight kaolinite dominance, alongside quartz and goethite, reflecting intense chemical weathering in a warm, humid paleoclimate. Geochemical trends indicate that sediments are derived from intermediate to felsic source rocks, as supported by REE patterns. The sediments exhibit passive continental margin affinities, with high chemical maturity due to prolonged weathering. Grain size distributions and elemental ratios (Sr/Ba < 1; variable V/(V + Ni)) suggest deposition in a fluvial to shallow marine environment, with fluctuating freshwater-brackish conditions and redox alternations. This study establishes the Cheruvathur Formation as a product of intense tropical weathering, mixed-energy depositional systems, and a tectonically stable margin, providing critical insights into the paleoenvironmental and stratigraphic evolution of northern Kerala."

    "abstract": "Stabilization of an expansive soil containing sulfate with lime fails to effectively mitigate the swelling behavior of these soils as a result of the occurrence of ettringite, a highly expansive mineral. This study evaluated the effectiveness of utilizing 15% Soma fly ash (SFA) as an alternative to 4% lime (L) in enhancing the stability of expansive soil containing sulfate (SO 4 ) against swelling. Maximum allowable SO 4 content for the stabilization of the expansive sulfate clay with SFA was investigated to achieve the greatest reduction in swell potential and simultaneously inhibit the formation of ettringite. Index, swelling, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, together with scanning electron microscope (SEM) views and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, were used to assess the impact of fly ash on the behavior of sulfate-bearing expansive soil. SO 4 concentration exhibited varying effects on the swell potential of treated specimens. A noticeable increase in the swell potential of expansive sulfate clay was observed when treated with 4% L, but no significant increase was observed when treated with 15% SFA. The UCS of the expansive sulfate clay specimens treated with both additives generally decreased. A significant reduction in strength was recorded for expansive sulfate clay treated with 15% SFA and exposed to 27,000 ppm SO 4 when cured at 10 °C, primarily due to ettringite/thaumasite and thenardite formation. The results indicated that 15% SFA can be safely used for stabilizing expansive soils containing SO 4 without causing heave or durability problems, provided that the SO 4 concentration of the expansive soil is below the threshold level of 6750 ppm."

    "abstract": "The impulsive amount of energy in the form of seismic waves (body and surface waves) is released during earthquakes and may cause loss of property and life. In this context, hazard analysis becomes an important touchstone to analyse the risk associated with seismic events. Earthquake influences are observed for several kilometres, but severe impact is observed within few kilometres of the epicentre of an earthquake that is a small part of the active fault what generated the earthquake. In this study, the deterministic seismic hazard analysis is carried out for Gujarat, India, considering the 300 km region measured from the Gujarat boundary within Indian territory. The deterministic seismic hazard analysis is carried out and the hazard is evaluated in the form of peak ground acceleration at the bedrock level considering four different scenarios: hazard due to past earthquake data only, hazard due to past earthquake data and all faults considered as active, hazard due to past earthquake data and only active faults and hazard due to past earthquake data and partial length of the active faults considered as active. The evaluated hazard is compared with IS 1893 Part 1 ( 2016 ) and those available in the literature. Based on different scenarios considered in the study, the observations on the deterministic seismic hazard analysis for the study region, Gujarat, are drawn."

    "title": "Reservoir characterization of Kolmani Field, Northeast Nigeria, using well log data and 3D seismic data for enhanced hydrocarbon prospectivity",
    "abstract": "Kolmani field in the Gongola Basin, Upper Benue Trough, northeastern Nigeria had been underexplored with only three exploratory wells. The source rocks have been proven good; the reservoirs are yet to achieve their potentials. Therefore, this work characterized the reservoirs within Kolmani Field using well log and 3D seismic data for enhanced hydrocarbon prospectivity. The identified aggradational sequences in Kowell-1 well (6536.88ft-8172.75ft) and Kowell-2 well (6413.80ft-8218.78ft) likely formed in a floodplain or shallow marine shelf environment. In contrast, the progradational sequences in Kowell-1 (5690.74ft—6536.88ft) and Kowell-2 (5234.33 to 6413.80 ft) suggest deltaic or shoreline deposits. The retrogradational sequences in Kowell-1 (5101–5690.74 ft) and Kowell-2 (6413.80–8218.78ft) indicate a probable transgressive marine shelf or estuarine environment. However, two wells (Kowell-1 and Kowell-2) were used for petrophysical evaluation. Faults, anticlinal structures, four reservoirs, four complete depositional cycles, one prospect, and two leads were delineated. Reservoir data from the two wells in the Yolde Formation indicated gross thicknesses range from 180.5 to 566.9 ft, with net-to-gross (N/G) ratios between 0.42 and 0.87. V-shale values vary from 0.25 to 0.46, while porosity (Phi) ranges from 0.17 to 0.34. Water saturation (Sw) is between 0.30 and 0.51, with hydrocarbon saturation (Sh) from 0.49 to 0.70. Permeability (K) values range from 400.86 to 900.25 mD, indicating good reservoir quality. The mapped prospect A has 26 BCF STGIIP and 69.47 Mbbl STOIIP. The volumetrics of reservoirs suggest that Kolmani field is a promising field for hydrocarbon exploration."

    "abstract": "The study is carried out in selected vulnerable localities in terms of shortage in water supply in the White Nile State, Sudan, which include El Salam, Guli, and El Gabalain localities. These locations are either situated on basement rocks or dominated by thick clayey deposits within the NW-trending isolated sedimentary rift basins. The primary goal of this study is to explore the groundwater potential zones in the selected areas. The methods of investigations are based on the integration of the processed satellite gravity data with the ground electrical resistivity survey using winner and Schlumberger configurations. The interpretation of satellite gravity data were done through the Residual Bouguer Anomaly (RBA) and second vertical derivatives (SVD) to define the configuration of the sedimentary basins as water-bearing formations. The high-density rocks are attributed to the basement rocks, where the low-density rocks are related to the sedimentary sequences in the (RBA) maps. The faults, plains, and deep fractures are delineated as sharp boundaries between different gravity anomalies in (VSD) maps. The conducted geo-electrical surveys were done on the gravity data findings, detecting the lateral and vertical variations of sub-surface geology that help to highlight the groundwater occurrences. The high resistivity values ≥ 200 Ώ m refer to the occurrences of basement rocks; the medium resistivity values 20–200 Ώ m refer to the aquifer zones, while the low resistivity values of ≤ 20 Ώ m refer to clayey sediments or to saline water in the region."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative study on under-reamed and helical piles under compressive and tensile loads. The study includes single-bulb, single-helix, double-bulb, double-helix, triple-bulb, triple-helix, and conventional pile types. The diameter and length for all the piles were 16 mm and 400 mm, respectively. Experimental studies were performed on the pile models under compressive loads using a tank of size 0.5 m × 0.5 m × 0.5 m. A numerical analysis was also conducted under compressive and tensile loading. The presence of bulbs and helices influenced the compressive and tensile behaviour of the piles. Under compressive loading conditions, it was observed that the triple bulb had a load-carrying capacity 5.5 times higher than the conventional pile and 4.7 times higher than the triple helix for the same settlement values. Comparing the load-carrying capacity of triple-bulb and triple helix piles under tensile loading, it was found that the former increased by 674% and 577%, respectively, over conventional piles. It has been observed that as the number of bulbs or helices increases, the pile’s settlement is reduced."

    "title": "A review of various analytical techniques for estimating subsurface heat flow regimes from aero-geophysical data",
    "abstract": "The present review x-rays the various analytical techniques for identifying, mapping, and estimating subsurface heat flow regimes from airborne geophysical data. The airborne geophysical techniques reviewed are the electromagnetic, gravity, magnetic, radiometric, and satellite remote sensing. Each of the reviewed geophysical techniques measures different subsurface Earth’s property indirectly through inversion techniques. The airborne electromagnetic study measures the electrical and magnetic properties of subsurface materials, while the airborne gravity survey measures the density contrast of subsurface materials. Also, while the airborne magnetic technique measures the magnetic susceptibility of subsurface rocks, the airborne radiometric survey measures the radioactive content of rocks. These geophysical properties (electrical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and density) are not measured directly but are estimated through the inversion of acquired geophysical data. Similarly, satellite imageries acquired from remote sensing records the spectral signatures of surface materials based on their various interactions with electromagnetic radiations. These techniques have been extensively applied worldwide by several researchers for various exploration and regional studies including mineral exploration, regional tectonic studies, and geothermal evaluation. In geothermal studies, Curie point depth, geothermal gradient, and heat flow have been derived from magnetic data using spectral inversion techniques, while radiogenic heat production can be estimated from radiometric data. Satellite remote sensing data typically analyzes spectral signatures of near surface materials for mapping of hydrothermal alterations, surface deformation, structural deformation, land surface temperature, geobotanic indicators, and other indicators. By analyzing these properties, it is possible to infer geothermal plays, evaluate the geothermal resource potentials, and locate prospective reserves for geothermal drilling operations. This study therefore aimed at assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the various techniques. The results of this study have revealed that no single technique is self-sufficient. The integration of multiple techniques can provide a more robust study leading to accurate and precise location of reserves for drilling programs, thus aiding in the exploration and development of geothermal energy resources."

    "abstract": "The study integrates multispectral ASTER and high-resolution AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data to identify bauxite-rich pockets within the lateritic terrain of Modigarh village, Chhatarpur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. ASTER L1B data were employed to delineate lateritic zones and lithological contact areas using Relative Band Depth (RBD) indices for gibbsite and laterite. To enhance mineral discrimination, AVIRIS-NG data were pre-processed through bad band removal and NDVI masking, followed by spectral analysis techniques including band math, RBD mapping, and Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU). Spectral signatures of gibbsite, boehmite, kaolinite, and hematite were identified by comparison with USGS reference spectra, field spectroradiometry, and laboratory data. False Color Composites, RBD images, and LSU-derived abundance maps effectively delineated bauxite-bearing zones. These remote sensing outputs were validated through petrographic studies revealing oolitic and pisolitic textures, and by XRF, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy confirming the mineralogical composition. The study highlights the effectiveness of combining spaceborne and airborne remote sensing technologies for high-resolution surface mapping of bauxite, offering a replicable methodology for similar lateritic terrains globally. This integrated approach supports efficient, non-invasive mineral exploration strategies and can significantly aid global bauxite resource assessments in tropical and sub-tropical regions."

    "abstract": "Prediction of ground motion by earthquakes is still the main issue for seismologists, engineers, and researchers. In this paper, the site response analyses (SRAs) have been carried out by considering the homogeneity, heterogeneity, and non-linearity of the soil, and the randomness of the seismic input. Analytical differential equations have been solved by calibrating boundary conditions. In this sense, the analyses can be considered accurate since the different effects have been studied separately in a more advanced way. The calibration has been made by using previous published studies and reliable software. Results are expressed in terms of horizontal displacements, accelerations, shear strains, and stresses. Results show that the heterogeneity effects depend on the shear wave velocity reaching, for heterogeneous soil, a value 10 times greater than that for homogeneity soil. Regarding the non-linearity and dynamic effects are more complicated to be framed by a unique conclusion. However, for some cases, the results appear similar to previous studies. In a more global way, it was possible to estimate direct approximations for non-linear homogeneous, dynamic homogeneous and heterogeneous soil in function of input data regarding the earthquake, usually known, as peak ground accelerations (PGAs) and maximum frequencies."

    "abstract": "Earthquakes have occurred near the Song Tranh 2 hydropower since the reservoir's impoundment in November 2010. These include several thousand earthquakes, with a magnitude Ml 4.7 event on 15 November 2012 being the largest. The Institute of Earth Sciences deployed digital data acquisition systems near the Song Tranh 2 reservoirs to investigate earthquake generation. In the present study, source parameters of 97 local events (1.0 ≤ M L ≤ 3.6) that occurred around the Song Tranh 2 region from September 2013 to April 2017 have been estimated by using spectral analysis. The source parameters including moment magnitude (M w ) seismic moment (M 0 ), source radius (r), displacement (s), corner frequency and stress drop (∆σ) are found to vary from 1.4 ÷ 3.7, 1.4 × 10 11 ÷ 4.3 × 10 14 Nm, 66.1 ÷ 188 m, 0.16 ÷ 10.4 mm, 6.9 ÷ 19.7 Hz and 0.2 ÷ 58 MPa, respectively. Empirical scaling laws among these parameters are developed for the first time in the region. Stress drops in the Song Tranh 2 region increase with magnitude and concentrate in the northern cluster near the reservoir at a depth of 3 to 4 km, consistent with the higher seismic activity observed in that area and depth range. The intersection of tectonic activity and Song Tranh 2 reservoir overburden pressure likely creates stress heterogeneities, leading to higher energy release and stress drops."

    "title": "Role of monsoonal changes in surface hydrography of the northwest Arabian Sea during the past 145 ka",
    "abstract": "This paper is primarily based on planktic foraminiferal census data from the past ~ 145 ka in the northwest Arabian Sea (ODP Holes 722B and 723A) to better understand surface water hydrographic changes. The temporal distribution of faunal records largely reflects both glacial-interglacial and millennial-scale changes in surface productivity in response to the monsoonal variations. The distinctive planktic foraminiferal assemblages reflect higher surface productivity resulting from intense southwest (SW) monsoon upwelling during interglacial MIS 1 and MIS 5 in both- coastal and open-ocean waters of the northwest Arabian Sea. Whereas the effect of the SW monsoon during MIS 3 was limited and contributed to the upwelling and surface productivity only in the coastal region. We also recorded the millennial-scale climate variability in the northwest Arabian Sea, which is closely linked with the extreme cold Younger Dryas (YD) event and several North Atlantic Heinrich (H) events. This explains the strong teleconnection between North Atlantic cold events and the reduced intensity of the southwest monsoon, resulting in a characteristic decline in surface productivity of the Arabian Sea. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of some faunal records allowed us to identify a Milankovitch and three sub-Milankovitch periodicities, which are both precession-driven and the harmonic progression of the precessional cycle, indicating that the high-resolution variabilities in surface productivity due to changing monsoonal strength are primarily governed by orbital forcing. The increased fragmentation of foraminiferal tests during interglacial intervals at deeper hole 722B (below OMZ) reflects increased carbonate dissolution, which could be caused by additional CO 2 release during the remineralization of a higher amount of organic matter."

    "title": "Statistical modeling of global solar radiation in East and Northeast Brazil",
    "abstract": "This aim of the study was to model monthly mean global solar radiation (KJ m −2 ) using hourly data from six locations in the State of Alagoas, located in eastern northeastern Brazil (ENEB). Seven probability distribution function (PDF) models were fitted and evaluated based on statistical indicators such as deviation from means (KJ m −2 ), root mean square deviation (RMSE, KJ m −2 ), mean absolute error (MAE, KJ m −2 ), and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ). The hourly data were collected between 2008 and 2016 from INMET’s automatic meteorological stations (EMA) in the coast (three), agreste (2), and sertão (1) climatic mesoregions. The best adjustments of the PDF were GEV (Arapiraca, Pão de Açúcar, and Palmeira dos Índios), Logistic (São Luiz do Quitunde), and EV (Maceió). These adjusted PDFs are essential for better assessing the variability of global solar radiation in the ENEB and for future use of solar energy as an energy matrix in the region, which has the worst socioeconomic indicators and high social vulnerability."

    "title": "Using mass balance analyses for heavy metal pollution assessment in some wetlands at Obuasi, Ghana",
    "abstract": "Mass balance estimates take into account every component of the environment under consideration, offering the most straightforward approach and enhancing assessments of heavy metals pollutions. This study estimates environmental pollution using mass balance values of Cd, As, Pb, Hg, and Fe in some wetlands at Obuasi, Ghana. The specific objectives are to (i) determine the concentrations of the elements in the wetlands, (ii) assess the mass balance ratio ( B R ) for each of the elements in the wetlands, and (iii) integrate the B R of the elements for the wetlands. The metal concentrations were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry procedure. Reference crustal average values for Cd, As, Pb, Hg, and Fe were used to calculate the B R for the elements. The B R values were integrated to generate geochemical mass balance ratio index ( B R I ). The element concentrations are above WHO/FAO permissible limits. Cd, As, and Hg B R s are > 1.3 at all sites indicating enrichment from mining, Pb B R of 1.090 show near equilibrium, while Fe B R of 0.06 indicate depletion. Average B R I values for the basins are 30.89, 67.68, and 42.83 for site-A, site-B, and site-C, respectively, dominated by Cd, As, and Hg. This indicates extra source of Cd, As, and Hg from human activities accumulate into the wetlands. In conclusion, the wetlands are not conducive for consumable livelihood venture, enrichment of Cd, As, and Hg is due to mining operations, and B R I provides strong synergistic and effective metric tool to monitor heavy metal pollution levels in wetland environment."

    "title": "Evaluating water supply and demand growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries: projections and policy implications for sustainable water resources management",
    "abstract": "The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries face severe water scarcity due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and unsustainable agricultural practices, creating an imbalance between water supply and demand. This study examines projected growth in water demand and supply over the next decade and its economic and environmental costs to inform policy development. Trends in water use were analyzed based on available data from 2010, with future projections extending to 2035 using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model. The study revealed that the GCC’s water consumption averaged 463 cubic meters per capita annually, with 76% used in agriculture, 19% in domestic use, and 5% in industry. Variations in growth rates across countries indicate a need for balanced water management policies. Reducing water demand growth to 1–2%, combined with controlled desalination, groundwater extraction, and treated wastewater reuse, could mitigate future shortages. Virtual water trade and demand management measures are proposed to enhance efficiency. The study estimates that adjusting water demand and supply growth rates could reduce CO 2 emissions by 1.645 million tons in 2024 and 31 million tons by 2035."

    "title": "Development and assessment of a regional water poverty index (WPI) model for Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC), Eastern India",
    "abstract": "Coal mining activities exacerbate water contamination and scarcity in the vicinity of the respective region. In this study, a regional water poverty index (WPI) model was developed to assess the water stress situation of Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC). The groundwater quality of DMC was assessed by collecting samples from 17 spatially distributed GIS-based locations. The cationic and anionic chemistry of groundwater showed the dominancy calcium (Ca 2+ ) followed by magnesium (Mg 2+ ) > sodium (Na + ) > potassium (K + ), and sulphate (SO 4 2− ) followed by chloride (Cl − ) > nitrate (NO 3 -) > fluoride (F − ), respectively. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of heavy metals and hydrogeochemical facies was investigated using ArcGIS 10.3 (MAP) and Origin (version 3.7) analytical tools. The concentration of Fe in groundwater of DMC varied from 216 to 2699 µg/L, surpassing BIS’s guideline value (300 µg/L). The estimated non-carcinogenic risks based on hazard index (HI) value were found to be higher in children (1.07E-01 to 5.55E-01) than in adults (1.04E-01 to 2.24E-01). The result of the present study is important for designing remediation scenarios for water scarcity and contamination in mining regions."

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted to assess the accuracy of interpolated climate data generated by the India Meteorological Department for Punjab. The temperature data was bias-corrected with three and rainfall with six techniques. The 21-year (2000–2020) data was divided into two periods; i.e. 2000–2010 data was used for computing correction factors, and the remaining period data was used for validation by comparing with the ground station actual datasets. In temperature parameters, the CF x (change factor daily basis) technique outperformed the SSBC x (simple seasonal bias correction) and BC x (bias correction daily basis) and showed excellent estimates similar to observed data. In the case of rainfall parameters, the CDF (cumulative distribution function) plots and KS (Kolmogorov–Smirnov) tests revealed no significant distribution differences across all locations before and after bias correction, except QMLC x (quantile mapping linear correction) and QMPC x (quantile mapping second-order polynomial correction) which added biases after bias correction. Amongst the six techniques evaluated for rainfall, the QM x (basic quantile mapping) method reduces biases compared to raw rainfall data. We, therefore, recommend the direct usage of IMD raw gridded data for rainfall and bias-corrected data for temperature for climate change impact analysis for use in agricultural planning."

    "title": "A simple piecewise C2 continuous smoothing technique to remove numerical singularities in Mohr–Coulomb criterion",
    "abstract": "The Mohr–Coulomb criterion represents a hexagonal pyramidal surface in the three-dimensional principal stress/strain spaces. There exist numerical singularities on the edges and at the apex of the pyramidal surface. An ideal technique for removing such singularities should be simple enough and can minimize the deviation. An early approach seems to meet the requirements but was found to be not smooth and poor in numerical astringency. Therefore, a simple piecewise C2 continuous smoothing technique was presented to remove the singularities posed by the vertexes of the Mohr–Coulomb locus in the deviatoric plane. Meanwhile, the linear Mohr–Coulomb envelope in the meridian plane was still preserved. The singularity at the apex was also removed. A subroutine that still uses the original Mohr–Coulomb criterion to determine the yielding of geomaterials but employs the piecewise C2 continuous smooth yield and potential surfaces to perform the relevant derivation operations was successfully developed in Abaqus using the fully implicit backward Euler integral regression algorithm. Its reliability was extensively validated by numerically modeling the triaxial compression and uniaxial tensile tests, as well as the stability analysis of a typical soil slope. The study highlighted the merit of this technique to be popularized in relevant numerical software."

    "title": "Durability of improved sandy soil using the soybean crude urease calcite precipitation (SCU-CP) method",
    "abstract": "Increasing the soil shear strength is necessary to prepare the soil before construction. Chemical and physical stabilization can increase the soil-bearing capacity. The latest chemical stabilization method is the calcite method. The calcite precipitation method of Soybean Crude Urease Calcite Precipitation (SCU-CP), which utilizes soybeans as a biocatalyst, was used in this study. In previous studies, the improvement in sand parameters after treatment with calcite precipitation has been verified; however, the results varied. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a durability test to evaluate the resistance strengthened by calcite. In this study, a durability test was conducted using a wet-dry cycle test, which evaluated the shear strength to determine changes in the parameters of shear strength, volume degradation, and sample mass. The soil treated by SCU-CP had a cohesion and an internal friction angle of 37.05 kPa and 14.27°, respectively. The durability test results showed that the cycle progressed, resulting in a decrease in the cohesion and internal friction of 58.68% and an internal friction angle of 70.15%, respectively, after the 5th cycle. In addition, the volume and mass of the treated soil decreased by 13.22%. This study elucidated that the improved soil using SCU-CP has great potential as an alternative soil improvement method; however, the control of wet-dry conditions in real field applications should be considered."

The comprehensive analysis involves the measurement of major oxides and mineral phases using complete and XRD analyses, while optical microscopy is utilized to verify the minerals present. Additionally, the zeta sizer technique is employed to ascertain the size of representative samples. Within the Duwi Formation, it could be subdivided vertically into three remarkable informal lithostratigraphic units. Notably, HPR and MPR exhibit elevated P 2 O 5 content (30.20 wt.% and 24.80 wt.%, respectively), contrasting with the decreased content in LPR (6.5 wt.%). These findings position HPR and MPR as promising high-reactive P fertilizers suitable for direct agricultural application and as valuable P fertilizer sources following nutrient balancing."

    "abstract": "The characterization of thin-bedded reservoirs is quite a challenging task, particularly as the reservoir thickness is below the seismic resolution limit. Geostatistical inversion efficiently integrates different datasets to create a high-resolution impedance model for improved characterization of the thin-bedded reservoirs. However, the optimal utilization of geostatistical inversion necessitates the availability of 3D seismic data. This study presents a novel approach for converting 2D seismic lines into a 3D grid, enabling the application of geostatistical inversion techniques. Different seismic features within the target interval (Lower Goru Formation) are correlated to investigate the credibility of the applied technique. Subsequently, geostatistical inversion is performed, and the obtained results are validated using gamma ray logs. It is observed that low gamma ray zones are in good agreement with the low impedance zones within the Lower Goru Formation. Even small variations in seismic impedance align with the variations depicted by wireline log data and pseudo-impedance logs. The adopted workflow can be utilized to build up the high-resolution impedance model of complex geological reservoirs without 3D seismic data."

    "abstract": "Water quality is truly essential for safe health and a basic requirement for different purposes. The 54 samples were collected from Mirpurkhas District, and sources of water were mainly hand pumps and bore pumps; mostly, these were used for human consumption and irrigation. The samples were collected from three subdistricts Mirpurkhas (18), Kot Ghulam Muhammad (20) and Shujabad (16). The samples were analyzed for 26 different parameters using standard analytical procedures. The samples on basis of total dissolved salts (TDS) (World Health Organization (WHO) limit of 1000 mg/L) were acceptable for drinking in the range of 22–55% within three subdistricts. The groundwater indicated acceptable alkalinity for 37.5–55%, chloride for 38.8–75%, sulphate 66–75%, Na 43.75–70%, K 22.2–37.5%, Ca 66.6–75%, Mg 72–75%, Cr 12.5–22.2%, Cd 25–38.8%, Pb 55.5–68.75%, Ni 37.5–40%, fluoride 55.5–81.1% and arsenic 85–100% samples within the permissible limits of WHO for drinking purposes. The results of analyses for nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate, total phosphate, pH, Fe, Cu, Mn and Co for all the samples were within the acceptable limits of WHO. The results were analyzed for multivariate statistical procedures, including coefficient of correlation, Piper diagram, principal component analysis, dendrogram and Gibb’s diagrams. The quality of groundwater depended on the rock dominance and several parameters correlated with each other indicating resemblance in geological settings in the area. The water quality index (WQI) for the samples was also calculated, and 61% of samples were in the excellent to good water category. The suitability of groundwater samples for irrigation based on sodium percent (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), Kelly’s index (KI), permeability index (PI) and Wilcox diagrams indicated that 39–95% were suitable for irrigation."

    "abstract": "In an era of increasing importance on sustainable urban ecosystems, this study examines arid region of Kuwait’s dramatic urban transformation over 20 years, highlighting the crucial collaboration between urban resilience, biophysical and morphological composition, land surface temperature (LST), and environmental sustainability. By utilizing the Landsat satellite imagery through geospatial and remote sensing techniques from 2003 to 2023, we identified significant trends in land use alterations and LST fluctuations at 6-year intervals. Our findings reveal a striking expansion of Kuwait’s built-up areas by 1246.51 km 2 (217.88%) over the study period, associated by a significant diminishing in water bodies (227.88 km 2 , 58.40%), barren land (884.02 km 2 , 5.48%), and vegetation (134.62 km 2 , 45.58%). Urban zones consistently exhibit elevated temperatures above 54.70 °C, attributed to amplified built-up lands and diminished vegetation, barren land, and water bodies. This study underscores the intricate nexus between LST dynamics and biophysical indicators, offering valuable insights for formulating robust environmental mitigation strategies and urban planning interventions. By illuminating the multifaceted interplay among urbanization, environmental dynamics, and climate change, our research aims to empower policymakers, urban planners, and practitioners to implement adaptive measures crucial for preserving ecological integrity amidst rapid urbanization and a shifting climate landscape."

    "abstract": "To address the susceptibility to softening instability in mottled red clay subgrade fillers from Jiangxi Province, a lime-fly ash composite modification approach was proposed. Systematic experimental investigations were conducted through a series of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests with designated fly ash (0%-25%) and lime (0%-8%) dosages, combined with immersion tests, wet-dry cycles, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses, to elucidate the strength evolution patterns and micro-mechanisms of modified soils. The test results show that: (1) the soil's UCS strength significantly increased after adding lime and fly ash to the mottled red clay. The strength increment from composite improvement with both lime and fly ash was more significant than the sum of the individual improvements, demonstrating a \"1 + 1 > 2\" synergistic effect; (2) After water immersion, the UCS of the soil modified with 3% lime and 15% fly ash and cured for 7 days, reached 538.22 kPa, meeting the railway subgrade fill specification of 350 kPa. After 28 days of curing, the UCS can be as high as 1176.85 kPa. Furthermore, the water stability and softening coefficients after five dry–wet cycles were 1.44 times and 2.25 times those of pure mottled red clay; (3) SEM analysis results indicate that while filling the pores, fly ash also acts as a network of solidified particle structures, forming rod-like and three-dimensional mesh structures with enhanced bonding forces between soil particles; and (4) An optimal ratio of 3% lime and 15% fly ash is recommended based on this study, which can be used as a reference for the modified mottled red clay field engineering application."

    "abstract": "This study assesses groundwater Quality and subsurface lithology in a residential area built on a reclaimed municipal waste dumpsite in Enugu, Nigeria. It addresses the potential environmental and health impacts of such sites, aligning with SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The objectives include groundwater Quality evaluation, subsurface characterization, and groundwater suitability assessment. Water samples from hand-dug wells were collected during both rainy and dry seasons over 2 years. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was employed to identify subsurface leachate pathways, while Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) was used to analyze eight heavy metals and 13 physicochemical parameters for groundwater quality index (WQI) calculation. ERT results revealed zones of low resistivity (0.5–7 Ωm) at depths of 5–16 m, indicating leachate presence. These zones were bordered by moderately resistive lateritic materials (58–199 Ωm). Most parameters fell within WHO permissible limits, except for cadmium (dry, 0.02 mg/L; wet, 0.17 mg/L), cobalt (dry, 0.02 mg/L; wet, 0.04 mg/L), temperature (dry, 28 °C; wet, 25 °C), and TSS (dry, 290 mg/L; wet, 110 mg/L). During the dry season, lead (0.15 mg/L) and total solids (TS) (720 mg/L) exceeded acceptable limits. pH values were slightly acidic, ranging from 5.0 (dry) to 5.5 (wet). The WQI scores of 987 (dry) and 3005 (wet) indicated high contamination in both seasons. Statistical analysis showed no significant seasonal variation in contaminant levels. Overall, geophysical and laboratory findings confirm that the groundwater is highly contaminated and poses serious health risks to residents."

    "title": "Application of 2D electrical resistivity tomography to recognize groundwater salinity sources relevant to the Messinian salinity crisis, Kert aquifer, NE of Morocco",
    "abstract": "Groundwater salinization poses a growing threat to water security and sustainable development in arid regions, particularly in northeastern Morocco. In the Kert Basin, increasing salinity levels compromise groundwater quality, especially in the southern and eastern areas, where total dissolved solids (TDS) exceed 12,000 mg/L. This study employs 2D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to characterize subsurface salinity patterns and investigate the geological and hydrological processes influencing salinization. A total of 20 resistivity profiles were acquired across the basin, with 12 selected for detailed analysis. The results reveal a clear spatial correlation between electrical resistivity and measured groundwater salinity. Low resistivity zones (< 20 Ωm) are associated with highly mineralized waters and Miocene marls, particularly in the east and south, whereas higher resistivity values (> 100 Ωm) in the northwest correspond to fresher water conditions (TDS < 600 mg/L). The study identifies two major sources of salinity: (1) the dissolution of evaporite minerals within the Miocene marls and (2) possible infiltration from the Kert River, which shows elevated electrical conductivity (3828 µS/cm) during seasonal flow. These findings align with previous hydrochemical and isotopic studies and underscore the value of ERT as a non-invasive method for delineating saline and fresh groundwater zones. By enhancing the understanding of subsurface salinization processes, this research contributes to the sustainable management of water resources in the context of climate-induced aridity and historical geological events such as the Messinian Salinity Crisis."

    "abstract": "Forest landscape restoration is important for the mitigation of climate change, conservation of biodiversity, protection of watersheds, provision of livelihoods, and enhancement of ecosystem services, thereby promoting environmental sustainability and human well-being on a global scale. This study investigates land cover changes in the Bunduki Gap, a region where eviction occurred in 2008 to establish biological connectivity between the northern and southern blocks of the Uluguru Nature Forest Reserve, in Morogoro, Tanzania. The research employs supervised image classification using the random forest algorithm on Google Earth Engine using high-resolution imagery from Quickbird 2005, Worldview 2011, and Pleiades 2017. It assesses classification accuracy, analyzes changes in land cover classes, tracks their persistence and trajectories, and examines spatial distribution for the periods 2005–2011 and 2011–2017. In 2005, the study area exhibited 1.74% forest, 16.01% bushland, 39.03% grassland, and 43.21% bare land. By 2011, these proportions shifted to 26.81%, 44.51%, 17.54%, and 11.14%, respectively. By 2017, the proportions further transformed to 51.80%, 31.79%, 13.41%, and 3.00%, respectively. The classification achieved a high overall accuracy of more than 90% for each respective year. The main result is the replacement of bare land, grassland, and bushland by forest land cover. The rate of this replacement differs temporally and spatially across the gap. The observed land cover changes were primarily driven by the cessation of farming activities, natural forest regeneration, and the influence of local conservation efforts following the eviction. The transition to forest cover has significant socioecological implications, including improved biodiversity connectivity, enhanced ecosystem services such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, and the potential for alternative livelihoods like ecotourism. The study recommends continuous monitoring and research to assess the emerging land cover’s composition and its similarity to the reserve’s northern and southern blocks."

    "abstract": "In water-stressed areas, delineating feasible zones for artificial recharge (AR) to groundwater and pinpointing suitable sites are a challenging task. This study applies a GIS-based analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to delineate groundwater recharge potential zones (GRPZs) by integrating multiple thematic layers. Pairwise comparisons and eigenvalue calculations yielded a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.09, confirming the reliability of the assigned weights. The resulting GRPZs map classifies the 14,122 sq.km study area into five categories: very high (9%), high (17%), moderate (29%), low (31%), and very low (14%). Northwestern and central areas show high recharge feasibility, while the eastern part has low to very low potential. The study also focuses on optimizing and distributing AR structures through a scientific approach for effective planning. Estimations are based on parameters such as weathered zone thickness, total area, rainfall, aquifer volume, water level, runoff, conductivity, and field data like well inventories, lithologs, and yield data. The total estimated unsaturated aquifer volume is 114,135 million cubic meters (MCM), which 124 MCM of surplus rainfall runoff available for recharge. Based on the analysis, a total 3602 artificial recharge (AR) structures, i.e., 2471 check dams (CDs) and 1131 percolation tanks (PTs) have been identified as feasible after accounting 7744 existing structures. Of these, 279 new AR structures (CDs and PTs with recharge shafts (RS)) are proposed in very high to moderate GRPZs. These are expected to harvest 7.17 MCM of rainwater, with 4.30 MCM recharged in drought-prone areas and also promoting farm-dug ponds aid sustainable, cost-effective groundwater recharge. Coastal and shallow water table regions are unsuitable for such interventions."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the stability of Rib dam slopes under varying reservoir water levels and drawdown conditions, considering sensitivity factors and their interactions. The dam is a zoned earth-rock dam constructed in the Tana basin, Ethiopia. The study utilized a combination of finite element and limit equilibrium methods to assess global sensitivity factors affecting zoned earth-rock dam slope stability. Statistical and regression analyses were then employed to identify critical influencers on the factor of safety of the dam’s slopes. The research involved analyzing one zone and all zones of the dam at a time, considering seepage and flow stresses. Results showed that factors like internal friction angle significantly impacted slope stability. Regression models were developed to predict safety factors based on drawdown time, reservoir water levels, and soil-rock parameters. Findings suggest that factors like internal friction angle play a crucial role in dam stability, with rapid drawdown conditions posing a risk to the upstream slope stability. The study provides insights into the importance of various factors in dam slope stability, aiding in determining appropriate design and stabilization measures."

    "abstract": "The study area (Egyptian Nile Valley, Upper Egypt, east Sohag Governorate) represents a minor slice of the El-Maaza Plateau, mainly composed of Lower Eocene carbonate succession. Three well-selected Lower Eocene sections were investigated (Wadi Bir Al-Ain, Awlaad El-Sheekh Village, and Hashem Al-Eseri Village). The studied Lower Eocene succession distinguished into distinct two formations: Thebes Formation (yellowish white laminated and bedded limestone with bands of chert and fine-sliciclastic beds) and conformably followed upward by Drunka Formation (snow white color, more or less horizontality and chert concretions). Field observations revealed numerous structural elements (faults, joints, folds, and shear zones associated with the Pan-African Orogeny) that greatly influenced the lithology and areal distribution of the Lower Eocene sequence. These structural elements were followed by a series of tectonic reactivations, especially during the Cretaceous and Oligocene periods. Particularly in the Wadi Bir Al-Ain, the carbonates of the Drunka Formation are often characterized by a distinct depositional cyclicity feature and more landward facies covering more basinward facies throughout each cycle. These cyclic carbonate deposits show shallowing upward, reflecting shallow epi-continental environmental conditions. The thickness of these cycles and lack of truncated cycles indicate that the amplitude of sea-level fluctuation and periodicity were generally consistent, pointing to a eustatic process for relative sea-level change rather than a tectonic one. Rockfalls, joints, tilting, and faulting are examples of deformation features seen within the Drunka Formation that could be post-depositional. Additionally, there is no argillaceous lithic succession within the Drunka Formation in the studied area. Consideration of the studied Lower Eocene rock units as carbonate ramp deposits was concluded based on thorough field investigations, sedimentological, and lithofacies of the studied Eocene succession, and careful reading of published works of Eocene rock units in Egypt and other international localities (Thebes Formation in inner-middle ramp environmental conditions and Drunka Formation in an outer-ramp environment). Based on standard classification schemes, five microfacies of the studied carbonate rock units (lime mudstone, lime wackestone, lime packstone, lime grainstone, and lime dolostones) were identified from the petrographic microfacies analysis conducted on 85 representative samples of the studied Lower Eocene succession. These microfacies were considered a main tool for better understanding the depositional environments of the studied Lower Eocene rock units."

    "title": "Evaluating climate change effects on water quality dynamics over multiple time scales: a case study of Iran’s Helle River basin",
    "abstract": "This study integrates multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) with climate-driven water quality dynamics to assess climate change impacts on Iran’s Helle River across multiple timescales. Unlike traditional linear models, this approach captures nonlinear, scale-dependent behaviors in water quality time series. Results show that climate change significantly alters water quality parameters: magnesium displays high sensitivity with notable variations, while acidity and sodium remain relatively stable. The study uniquely identifies scale-specific multifractal signatures, such as acidity ( Δα = 1.27) and sulfate ( Δα = 1.07), highlighting their variability under climate forcing. Nonlinear models sensitive to extreme fluctuations are recommended for accurate medium- and long-term forecasting, contrasting with linear models suited for short-term predictions. These findings link multifractal dynamics to climate-induced water quality changes, offering a framework for region-specific adaptation strategies. The outcomes provide actionable insights for sustainable water management in semi-arid regions facing climate extremes, advancing the understanding of complex climate-river interactions."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the assessment of geo-factor weights for the development of Geographic Information System (GIS)-based seismic hazard map, using a simplified Empirical Susceptibility Weights Approach (ESWA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for Thiruvananthapuram city, a rapidly growing urban area in the southern Peninsular India (PI). The influencing factors related to the ground characteristics, contributing to the seismicity of the region considered as inputs for the development of the model/map, include the peak ground acceleration (PGA), geology, lineaments/faults, geomorphology, elevation, slope, soil distribution, and building density pertaining to the study area. The thematic factors and the classes within each factor are assigned respective weights and ranks, using a hybrid evaluation of ESWA and AHP methods for an unbiased estimation of susceptibility levels of attributes. Based on the thematic layer weights and rank values, Susceptibility Index (SI) was finally calculated by applying a weighted linear combination (WLC) model in GIS. These continuous numerical index values have been divided into different classes. The classification result implies that it provides distinctive distribution of risk levels varying from very low to high ranges in the seismic hazard mapping of Thiruvananthapuram city, and the PGA corresponding to the high-risk zone in the region had been estimated."

    "title": "Morphology and orientation of paleochannel and its relationship to basement ridge in the western Ganga Plain",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the morphology of ancient fluvial systems in the Ganga–Yamuna interfluve and examines the potential influence of basement topography, specifically the Delhi–Haridwar Ridge (DHR), on their evolution. Using LANDSAT-8 false-colour composite imagery, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) maps, SRTM DEM, and borehole lithological data, two distinct types of paleochannels were identified: type 1, characterized by anastomosing patterns and type 2, exhibiting meandering forms. These paleochannels, with an average width of approximately 2.1 km, indicate the presence of a larger river system that was abandoned likely during a halted megafan-building event between the Late Pleistocene-Holocene. The borehole lithology analyses reveal four lithofacies associations (LA-1 to LA-4) indicating different depositional environments under different tectonic and climatic conditions. LA-1 may represent the basal depositional unit consisting of coarse sand and gravel, indicating high-energy braided river system, and may imply the lateral migration of the major rivers across the megafan surface and likely interpreted as relict channel deposits. Orientation analysis using azimuthal extraction techniques revealed that both the paleochannels and the DHR share a predominant NNE–SSW trend. Statistical correlation using the chi-square test yielded values between 9 and 18, below the critical threshold of 28, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the basement topography significantly influenced paleochannel development. This study underscores the importance of subsurface structural features in shaping ancient drainage systems and offers new insights into the tectonic and geomorphic evolution of the Ganga Plain."

    "abstract": "This study presents the petrographical and geochemical data of the metamorphic rocks from the Bikélélé area in order to constrain their petrogenetic evolution, provenance source and tectonic setting. These rocks include biotite gneisses, amphibolites, hornblende gneisses, clinopyroxene amphibolites, epidote amphibolites, actinolite-chlorite schists, quartzites and mica schists. The biotite gneisses exhibit analogous geochemical features with sanukitoids, as well as negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*) N = 0.4–0.61 in their REE chondrite-normalised patterns. The metavolcanic rocks have high SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , MgO, CaO, Mg#, low to high fractionation (La/Yb) N = 0.89–39.45 and negative to no Eu anomalies (0.43–1.07). Both the biotite gneisses and metavolcanic rocks show depletion in Nb, Ta and Ti in their primitive mantle-normalised diagrams. The metasedimentary rocks exhibit high SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 and enriched light rare earth element (LREE) with depleted heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns. Based on the geochemical characteristics, we suggest that the melts of the biotite gneiss protoliths formed by the partial melting of a high-K rich mantle that was metasomatised by melts derived from subduction-related terrigenous sediments associated with oceanic slab. The metavolcanic rocks likely formed at shallow depths, by 2.5–4% partial melting of a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source that was enriched through metasomatism involving sediments, melts and subduction-related fluids. However, the metasedimentary rocks originated from the Archean granitoids of the Chaillu Massif that underwent an intermediate tropical weathering. Based on the literature and data of this study, a subduction-arc environment associated with a back-arc extensional basin was suggested as the potential tectonic setting of these rocks."

    "abstract": "Gold in stream sediments at Eseka located within the metasedimentary Nyong Unit (Ntem Complex) is known as an artisanal mining site. The primary source of gold remains unknown, and an adequate exploration model is of concern. This study uses the morphology and microchemistry of the gold grains and trace element geochemistry to constraint its primary source. Scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, inductively coupled plasma optical emission/mass spectrometry, and multivariate statistics were used for these investigations. The results show that gold grains are irregular, elongated, or angular and display a size variation of 0.5 to 1.4 mm. Au count in the studied sediments ranges from 2 to 5, and a few sub-rounded grains with groovy surface topography are observed. These indicate a short transportation distance (~ 1000 m) through fluvial system and proximity to the Au primary source. Eseka sediments contain Au (> 1000 ppb), Ag (0.1–1.1 ppm), and Hg (< 0.05 ppm), and two main element associations (Hg-La-Mo-Pb-Th and Ba-Co-Cr-Cu-V) have been determined. Au (93.32–100.01 wt%) is alloyed with Ag (0.119–2.660 wt%), Cu (0.010–0.378 wt%), Hg (0–0.037 wt%), and Te (0–0.011 wt%) with a narrow fineness (935–999). The mineralization in Eseka is classified as very high grade Au which is linked to a mesothermal/orogenic source similar to some Au deposits of the Ntem Complex. A prospective zone has been identified and can be explored using field geologic mapping, pitting-trenching, geophysical method, and soil and stream sediment geochemistry."

    "abstract": "The variable climatic conditions pose a significant threat for food safety, affecting crop yield. To address this challenge, it is essential to establish an operational grain yield forecasting system at the beginning of the growing season. Such a system would assist decision-makers in conducting early assessments. There is a need to create easier methods to estimate crop yield, as the application of the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), obtained from satellite sensors and fractional green canopy cover (FGCC), derived from the Canopeo® application. This research aimed to assess and compare measurements of NDVI, FGCC, and crop biomass values across various growth stages of wheat and barley. Experimental trials were conducted over the growing seasons of 2019–2020, 2020–2021, and 2021–2022 in Setif, Algeria. The results show that FGCC the most accurate estimator for wheat and barley grain yield R 2 ranged from 0.781 to 0.783, surpassing crop biomass ( R 2 ranged from 0.659 to 0.712) and NDVI ( R 2 ranged from 0.637 to 0.642). The FGCC’s (RMSE) ranged from 0.051 to 0.107 tha −1 , biomass RMSE varied between 0.092 and 0.172 tha −1 , and NDVI RMSE fluctuated from 0.085 to 0.186 tha −1 . These findings suggest that the Canopeo® application proved to be a fast and reliable tool to estimate wheat and barley grain yield."

    "abstract": "Water scarcity and climate change are significant challenges for sustainable water management worldwide. Factors such as population growth, industrial development, and unsustainable practices are increasing water demand. The upstream oil and gas energy industry faces water management challenges, including sourcing, treating, transporting, and disposing of water while meeting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements. This study introduces the Water Usage Efficiency Index (WUEI) using artificial intelligence in Python, a novel quantitative framework aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals. The WUEI assesses water management in upstream energy operations by analysing water intensity, source sustainability, and temporal variability. Data from the Alberta Energy Regulator and oil sands operators are used to evaluate operational efficiency and water recycling rates from 2013 to 2022. WUEI scores range from 0.624 to 2.130, highlighting areas for improvement and guiding water management strategies. This standardised approach supports ESG objectives and promotes industry best practices. The research offers a practical, AI-enhanced method for evaluating water efficiency in the oil and gas sector, contributing to sustainable water management and ESG goals. Collaboration among academia, industry, and policymakers is essential for the widespread adoption of the WUEI framework."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel machine learning–based framework for estimating fractional cycle biases (FCBs) to enhance ambiguity resolution in precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR). While previous studies have relied on traditional models such as the single difference between satellites (SDBS) technique, our work is the first to modify this model by integrating supervised learning algorithms—specifically support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)—to improve the precision of FCB estimation. The key novelty lies in enabling accurate estimation of even low-magnitude FCB values, which has a direct impact on shortening the convergence time—a known limitation of PPP techniques. Experimental evaluations using real GNSS datasets demonstrate that the SVM-based model significantly outperforms both RF and traditional SDBS approaches in FCB estimation accuracy. These findings establish a new direction for improving PPP-AR performance using data-driven methods, making the approach highly relevant for real-time geodetic and navigation applications where rapid convergence is critical."

    "abstract": "An integrated k -means clustering of well log data from Mara field, Niger Delta, Nigeria, has been carried out. This is with a view to segmenting well data into different facies based on their physical and geological properties. The relationship between the cluster labels and the facies types was studied using cross-plots, histograms, and statistical analysis. The results obtained from cluster prediction were compared with conventional methods of well log interpretation. Three well datasets from Mara field (Mara-1, Mara-2, and Mara-3) containing gamma ray, neutron porosity, density, and deep resistivity logs were used. The well data was subjected to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, outlier detection and removal, feature selection, and scaling to make the data more suitable for machine learning (ML) methods. Due to missing data in density and neutron porosity logs that might have occurred as a result of various reasons, including tool failures, depth misalignments, and manual removal of bad data, Mara-3 well was dropped for clustering as the issue could significantly impact petrophysical analyses and machine learning model performance. The k -means clustering algorithm was implemented using the Scikit-learn library. The elbow method and silhouette score were then applied to cluster the datasets as well as evaluate the number of clusters. The elbow method approximated the cluster level to be at 3, while with further evaluation, the silhouette score gave the optimum level of clustering with its highest value at cluster level of 2. A cluster level of 2 was selected to be the best with the highest score of 0.552, denoting that the data points are very compact within the cluster to which they belong. Based on the clustering results, different facies (shale and sandstone) were recognized successfully. The reservoir unit of sandstone and shale intercalations was delineated from the two wells and a dynamic depositional environment. Comparison of the identified facies units with conventional method of interpretation showed that the k -means algorithm was able to cluster the data and correlate them with depth."

    "abstract": "Nigeria’s renewed efforts to increase its declining reserves by exploring oil and gas resources in Cretaceous sedimentary basins have led to the necessity to reevaluate hydrocarbon potentials in the Central Benue Trough. This study uses field data sets, satellite-based observations, organic geochemistry, aeroradiometric data, and aeromagnetic data to look at intrasedimentary volcanic formations and detailed aeromagnetic and radiometric data in the Akiri region of the Central Benue Trough. We apply various enhancement methodologies to chart the structural and stratigraphic layout of the basement and enhance depth delineation, extending from 55.17 m to approximately 6735 m. Among these techniques for improving things are the first vertical derivative, analytic signal, source parameter imaging, Euler deconvolution, 2D power spectrum, center for exploration targeting (grid and porphyry), ratio maps, ternary maps, percentage potassium (%K), percentage thorium (eTh), and radiometric analyses. The results show six lithological units, several magmatic intrusions, and undulating and highly faulted basement surfaces with horst and graben structures. We determine shale to be the principal source rock for hydrocarbon maturation. The Central Benue Trough’s center region has a higher potential for hydrocarbon occurrence. However, further geophysical (seismic and well) studies are necessary to accurately locate and evaluate possible hydrocarbon reserves. Field and organic geochemical validation confirm the existence of important mapped structures. This gives more evidence that oil and gas could be extracted from the coal and shale formations."

    "abstract": "In the eastern region of the Indian Shield, the Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt (EGMB) is renowned for its intricate geological history, shaped by the transformation of rock formations under increasing pressure and temperature. Shear zones are one of the prominent structural features within this area. This study aims to identify structural anomalies in the deeper layers near the Mahanadi River using magnetotelluric (MT) techniques to understand the structural characteristics. Nine MT soundings were conducted along the Mahanadi Shear Zone (MSZ) and Angul-Dhenkanal Shear Zone (ADSZ), forming a nearly north–south-oriented profile spanning approximately 74 km. A two-dimensional resistivity model was constructed based on the inversion of these nine MT soundings, using an initial model with a resistivity of 100 Ωm. The resulting 2D inverted model revealed lateral inhomogeneities, indicating conductive zones that confirm the presence of the pre-existing shear zones along the profile. The model also shows that the shallow subsurface has high electrical resistivity (> 125 Ωm), possibly due to highly metamorphosed rocks, while the deeper zones display a conductive signature (< 10 Ωm)."

    "abstract": "Dynamic reservoir characterization involves analyzing a reservoir’s behavior over time, particularly as fluids (like oil, gas, and water) are produced or injected. The main objective of the study is to assess the dynamic reservoir characteristics of the Haripur oil field, Sylhet, Bangladesh in synchronous and post production phases by applying streamline simulation technique. The field started production in 1987 and terminated in 1994 producing approximately 0.53 MMSTB of oil. In the current study, the dynamic behavior of the Haripur reservoir has been assessed based on some key performance indicators such as flow line concentration, oil flow rate, pressure and time of flight (TOF). The indicators were obtained by using Petrel 2009 software platform from production data gathered during the well’s peak and late production phases. Flow line concentrations which refer to the accumulation of streamlines within a specific region indicating variations in flow velocity and pressure, show a considerable connectedness among the flow paths between synchronous and post production periods. Oil flow rate is decreased significantly among the periods. The flow pressure has been decreased by 91.74% within synchronous and post production phases. On the other hand, the TOF and oil saturation have experienced only a minor variation that implies the presence of significant amount of oil in the reservoir till the present day. This study presents a novel application of streamline simulation to evaluate the dynamic reservoir characteristics of the Haripur oil field in Bangladesh, focusing on both synchronous and post-production phases—an approach rarely applied in regional reservoir analyses. By examining unique indicators such as flow line concentration, time of flight, and pressure decline, this research provides critical insights into remaining reservoir potential and connectivity that can inform future production and development strategies."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is a vital sector of Ethiopia’s economy, yet the country frequently experiences recurring droughts in various regions. Despite possessing substantial water resources and land suitable for irrigation, Ethiopia utilizes only a fraction of its irrigation potential. This study employs Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to identify suitable areas for surface irrigation in the Lower and Middle Awash sub-basin. Key factors—such as slope, soil texture, soil salinity, soil depth, land use/land cover, and proximity to the Awash River—were analyzed using the weighted overlay tool in ArcGIS. The results indicate that 6.4% of the study area ishighly suitable for surface irrigation, while approximately 78.2% is moderately suitable. Additionally, about 5.3% of the land is classified as marginally suitable, and 10.1% is deemed not suitable for surface irrigation. Despite this potential, only around 0.96% of the study area is currently under surface irrigation, primarily within the highly and moderately suitable zones. The study concludes that approximately 83.3% of the area holds significant potential for surface irrigation, which could enhance agricultural productivity, reduce the impact of drought, and improve local livelihoods. This finding offers a valuable foundation for policymakers and stakeholders to design and implement sustainable irrigation projects in the study area and its surrounding environment. Future research should incorporate groundwater potential as a critical factor in identifying suitable areas for irrigation."

Over the past 200 years, these plate boundaries have caused numerous strong And great earthquakes, and the comprehensive study that followed led to the creation of modern seismology. During 2023, three moderate magnitude earthquakes with shallow focus (1) A 5.4 M with 16 km depth on 14 August 2023 in Bangladesh, (2) A 5.2 M with depth of 10 km on 2 October 2023 near North Garo Hills, Meghalaya, and (3) 5.6 M with depth of 55 km on 2 December 2023 near Ramganj, Bangladesh, occurred And created a widespread shaking and small-scale damages in various parts of Northeast India. Isoseismal lines of these earthquakes have been prepared using more than 200 crowdsource datasets and field survey in the different demographic spectrum of the area. These earthquakes have caused rupture of (1) 2.86% in Sylhet fault, (2) 19.70% in Cherdang fault, and (3) 4.98% in Gomati fault. This study highlights the significance of collecting extensive data on numerous faults in order to comprehend the current tectonics in various tectonic frameworks and to prepare for a better mitigation plan."

Following several trials on the physical model, the experiment was carried out using samples obtained from the field site, where HVDM was applied to improve the soil properties. The successful application of HVDM within the physical model resulted in achieving 94% relative compaction, accompanied by significant enhancements in soil strength: specifically, a 37% increase in unconfined compressive strength and a 38% rise in triaxial deviator strength, as well as a significant improvement in cohesion and angle of internal friction relative to untreated conditions. Also, the experimental observations, including the pore pressure response, settlement behavior, and visual evidence, all indicate a significant enhancement in soil stiffness following HVDM treatment, accompanied by rapid consolidation and increased density. The application of HVDM enables the achievement of the desired soil stiffness within the shortest possible timeframe."

    "abstract": "This study delves into the comprehensive analysis of sand samples sourced from various mineralogical origins within the Kashmir region. Five distinct sand samples—Sumbal Sonewari sand soil, Kitchpora Wuyul 1 sand soil, Kitchpora Wuyul 2 sand soil, Preng sand soil, and Sumbal Sonmarg sand soil—were selected for examination. The primary objective is to elucidate fundamental characteristics crucial for understanding sand’s utility as a primary construction material in Kashmir. Experimental procedures, adhering to standard protocols, were conducted in the laboratory. Specific gravity measurement followed IS 2720-Part 3, water absorption testing adhered to IS: 3495, and sieve analysis complied with IS code 2386. Grain size distributions were evaluated through wet mechanical analysis, categorizing the samples as “poorly graded sand.” Additionally, mineralogical properties were scrutinized employing X-ray fluorescence and FE-SEM techniques to unveil the influence of mineralogy on physical attributes. Results indicate that Preng sand soil exhibited the highest specific gravity (2.62), while Kitchpora Wuyul 1 had the lowest (2.49). Water absorption tests revealed significant variation, with Sumbal Sonmarg (4.28%) and Kitchpora Wuyul 2 (4.09%) showing the highest rates, whereas Sumbal Sonewari (0.57%) and Preng (0.9%) exhibited the lowest. Gradation analysis classified all samples as poorly graded sand, requiring additional treatment for improved suitability in construction. These findings underscore the imperative need for reinforcement measures in utilizing such sand in construction endeavors to ensure structural integrity and durability. This research contributes valuable insights into optimizing the selection and application of sand resources in construction projects within the Kashmir region, enhancing sustainability and efficacy in infrastructure development."

A model was obtained using linear regression statistical analysis to estimate the SSC using backscatter values. The results indicate that the estimated average concentrations of SSC were 0.13 g L −1 . The tidal regime governs the current velocities near the mouth of the river and the SSCs. The average flow of the Grijalva-Usumacinta River is 5136 m 3 s −1 , transporting a sediment load of 214.1 \\(\\times\\) 10 3 to 1467.2 \\(\\times\\) 10 3 m 3 month −1 . The sediment was predominantly silt and clay comprising terrigenous inorganic matter. A highly dynamic mouth bar is generated by suspended sediment transport."

    "abstract": "This study presents a cloud-based framework for the large-scale assessment of soil erosion using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) Observatory platform automates the mapping of erosion and sediment yield, which has been validated in Moroccan watersheds ( R 2 = 0.89). The GEE implementation outperforms conventional GIS methods through enhanced computational efficiency and global dataset integration. Adaptable RUSLE parameters enable worldwide application across diverse climates. The SWC Observatory facilitates real-time scenario analysis for informed land management decisions. This approach provides open-access tools for erosion prediction, particularly valuable in data-scarce regions. The framework advances sustainable land management through replicable, precise assessment methodologies."

    "title": "Long-term changes in dissolved organic matter quality are unrelated to ecosystem recovery from acidification in the Adirondack region (New York, USA)",
    "abstract": "Increasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and changing dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality in surface waters, a phenomenon known as browning, have been observed at global scales with a range of implications for ecosystem structure and function, global carbon cycling and human health. Ecosystem recovery from chronic acidification resulting from rapid declines in acid deposition over recent decades has been the leading explanation for surface water browning. In this study, long-term dynamics of the quantity, quality, and seasonality of DOM in surface waters of an acid-resistant Adirondack lake and its forested watershed were investigated during a period of rapid regional changes in both acidic deposition and climate (1999–2018). Overall, we found that trends in DOM quality have occurred while the overall quantity and seasonality of DOC fluxes changed little during the same time frame. Lack of DOC trends was consistent with expectations for this acid-resistant ecosystem. Model reconstructions of DOM quality during this period indicated shifts towards a greater proportion of terrestrially-sourced DOM from the watershed, but with occasional ‘pulses’ of more microbially-processed DOM associated with periods of heavy rainfall and high discharge. Our findings suggest that ecologically meaningful changes in DOM quality may be occurring in acid-resistant ecosystems, aside from trends in DOC driven by ecosystem recovery from acid impairment."

    "title": "Freshwater faces a warmer and saltier future from headwaters to coasts: climate risks, saltwater intrusion, and biogeochemical chain reactions",
    "abstract": "Alongside global climate change, many freshwater ecosystems are experiencing substantial shifts in the concentrations and compositions of salt ions coming from both land and sea. We synthesize a risk framework for anticipating how climate change and increasing salt pollution coming from both land and saltwater intrusion will trigger chain reactions extending from headwaters to tidal waters. Salt ions trigger ‘chain reactions,’ where chemical products from one biogeochemical reaction influence subsequent reactions and ecosystem responses. Different chain reactions impact drinking water quality, ecosystems, infrastructure, and energy and food production. Risk factors for chain reactions include shifts in salinity sources due to global climate change and amplification of salinity pulses due to the interaction of precipitation variability and human activities. Depending on climate and other factors, salt retention can range from 2 to 90% across watersheds globally. Salt retained in ecosystems interacts with many global biogeochemical cycles along flowpaths and contributes to ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ chain reactions associated with temporary acidification and long-term alkalinization of freshwaters, impacts on nutrient cycling, CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O, and greenhouse gases, corrosion, fouling, and scaling of infrastructure, deoxygenation, and contaminant mobilization along the freshwater-marine continuum. Salt also impacts the carbon cycle and the quantity and quality of organic matter transported from headwaters to coasts. We identify the double impact of salt pollution from land and saltwater intrusion on a wide range of ecosystem services. Our salinization risk framework is based on analyses of: (1) increasing temporal trends in salinization of tributaries and tidal freshwaters of the Chesapeake Bay and freshening of the Chesapeake Bay mainstem over 40 years due to changes in streamflow, sea level rise, and watershed salt pollution; (2) increasing long-term trends in concentrations and loads of major ions in rivers along the Eastern U.S. and increased riverine exports of major ions to coastal waters sometimes over 100-fold greater than forest reference conditions; (3) varying salt ion concentration-discharge relationships at U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) sites across the U.S.; (4) empirical relationships between specific conductance and Na + , Cl − , SO 4 2− , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + , and N at USGS sites across the U.S.; (5) changes in relationships between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and different salt ions at USGS sites across the U.S.; and (6) original salinization experiments demonstrating changes in organic matter composition, mobilization of nutrients and metals, acidification and alkalinization, changes in oxidation–reduction potentials, and deoxygenation in non-tidal and tidal waters. The interaction of human activities and climate change is altering sources, transport, storage, and reactivity of salt ions and chain reactions along the entire freshwater-marine continuum. Our salinization risk framework helps anticipate, prevent, and manage the growing double impact of salt ions from both land and sea on drinking water, human health, ecosystems, aquatic life, infrastructure, agriculture, and energy production."

    "title": "Methane flux from living tree stems in a northern conifer forest",
    "abstract": "Methane (CH 4 ) is the second-largest contributor to human-induced climate change, with significant uncertainties in its terrestrial sources and sinks. Tree stems play crucial roles in forest ecosystem CH 4 flux dynamics, yet much remains unknown regarding the environmental drivers of fluxes. We measured CH 4 flux from three tree species ( Picea rubens, Tsuga canadensis, Acer rubrum ) along an upland-to-wetland gradient at Howland Research Forest, a net annual sink of CH 4 , in Maine USA. We measured fluxes every two weeks and at three heights from April to November 2024 to capture a range of environmental conditions. Tree species influenced CH4 flux more than any of the environmental variables considered. Among environmental variables, soil moisture was the most important driver of CH 4 flux, and our models suggested a significant interaction between soil moisture and soil temperature, such that the effect of higher soil moisture was greater at warmer soil temperatures. We determined a “breakpoint” in soil moisture along the upland-to-wetland gradient at ~ 60% volumetric water content, above which CH 4 flux rates increased dramatically. All stems measured were net CH 4 sources throughout the sampling period, with rare, isolate measurements of minimal uptake. The magnitude of flux varied by species: red maple stems were the largest emitters (1.946 ± 5.917 nmol m −2 s −1 , mean ± SD), followed by red spruce (0.031 ± 0.065) and eastern hemlock (0.016 ± 0.027). This study highlights the contribution of these species to ecosystem CH 4 fluxes. Our results establish the sensitivity of stem flux rates to projected increases in regional precipitation and temperature, potentially shifting the site from a net CH 4 sink to a source."

    "title": "Sedimentology and relative sea level changes recorded in the Cretaceous Abeokuta Group, offshore Eastern Dahomey Basin, Nigeria: a core-based study",
    "abstract": "The stratigraphy and depositional environment of Cretaceous to Paleocene sediments in the Nigerian sector of the Dahomey Basin remain contentious due to limited outcrops and boreholes. Previous knowledge of the lithofacies of older sediments in the onshore portion was largely inferred from geophysical exploration, while the sedimentology and depositional setting of the offshore section have not been documented in the literature. This study investigates the sedimentary facies and depositional environments of the sediments from the offshore Eastern Dahomey Basin, Nigeria, using core samples from well DN (depth: 2096–2150 m). Record of the vertical succession reveals lithologic characteristics such as channelized sandstone units, sand/heterolithic interbeds, varying sand/silt/mud heterolithic capturing alternations of bioturbated and non-bioturbated intervals, several Glossifungites demarcated discontinuity surfaces, and occasional fossiliferous sandstone. Many of the units/facies are recurrent, defined by sedimentary structures such as wavy, laser, lenticular, bidirectional beddings, cross bedding, consistent mud laminae and mud-rapes, coalified detritals, reactivation surfaces, and inclined heterolithic stratification. Six facies associations typical of ancient estuary-barrier mouth sediments were delineated, including fluvial channel, tidally influenced fluvial channel, intertidal flats, tidal sand bars, estuarine embayment, and shoreface. From the depth, 2150 to about 2114.5 m, the cores exhibit characteristics of a tide-dominated estuary bearing several transgressive surfaces of erosion; in contrast, 2114.5 to 2096 m corresponds to a regressive package of wave-dominated shoreface complex, characterized by initial predominance of suspension feeding structures at the lower shoreface and a generalized shallowing-upward succession. Trace fossil analysis reveals recurrent Skolithos and Cruziana assemblages, suggesting a brackish setting. The recurrence of Glossifungites ichnofacies helps identify surfaces of erosion/transgression and other stratigraphic surfaces which further strengthen an estuary setting for sediments. Abeokuta Group is a macrotidal estuary, and our findings suggest that Ise Formation represents a fluvial region, the Afowo Formation is a tide-dominated estuary, and Araromi Formation is the wave-dominated shoreface. This study provides new insights into the sedimentological evolution of the Abeokuta Group in the offshore Eastern Dahomey Basin."

    "abstract": "The application of surface agricultural practices (SAPs) to agricultural soils is gaining attention as a potential valuable method for sequestering carbon and improving soil fertility. However, the impacts of SAPs on the molecular properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil leachates are poorly understood. In this study, the molecular characteristics of DOM successively leached from agricultural soils applied with control, manure fertilization, lucerne planting, and straw return were unraveled by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The results indicated that the greater proportion of low molecular weight labile DOM (lipids-like, proteins-like and carbohydrates-like) in initial soil leachates gradually changed to higher fractions of larger recalcitrant DOM (condensed aromatics-like and tannins-like) in later soil leachates. Compared to the control, the soil leachates treated with SAPs had greater percentage of labile DOM and lower percentage of recalcitrant DOM, along with higher abundance of CHNO and CHOS compounds. Furthermore, DOM in the manure, lucerne, and straw treatments showed smaller mass weights, higher H/C ratios and fewer double bonds, rings, and aromatic structures. DOM with different physicochemical properties play different roles in the processes of nitrogen cycling and arsenic migration. The implementation of SAPs may alleviate groundwater nitrogen pollution, but it may also enhance the potential risk of arsenic mobility in groundwater. This study deepens our understanding of the molecular characterization of DOM leached from agricultural soils applied with different SAPs, which holds significant implications for evaluating the environmental impacts of soil DOM leaching."

    "title": "Greenhouse gas fluxes from two drained pond sediments: a mesocosm study",
    "abstract": "Ponds can store large amounts of organic matter (OM) in their sediments, often accumulated over long periods of time. Sediment OM is largely protected from aerobic mineralization under water saturated conditions but are vulnerable when exposed to oxygen during periods of drought. As climate change progresses, drought periods are likely to occur more frequently and may affect OM mineralization, and thus the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from pond ecosystems. Therefore, we aimed to test how GHG emissions and concentrations in the sediment respond to drought by gradually decreasing water levels to below the sediment surface. To this end, undisturbed sediment cores from two small ponds with distinct watershed and water chemistry characteristics were incubated in mesocosms for 118 days at 20 °C. Water levels were sequentially tested at 3 cm above the sediment surface (Phase I) and at the level of the sediment surface (Phase II). In Phase III, water levels were continuously lowered either by evaporation or by active drainage including evaporation. Mean CH 4 fluxes of both ponds were high (21 and 87 mmol m −2 d −1 ), contributing 90 and 96% to the GHG budget over the three phases. The highest CH 4 fluxes occurred in Phase II, while active drainage strongly reduced CH 4 fluxes in Phase III. A multivariate analysis suggests that dissolved organic carbon and sulphate were important drivers of CH 4 fluxes in Phase III. CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes also responded to declining water levels, but their contribution to the GHG budget was rather small. Both gases were primarily produced in the upper sediment layer as indicated by highest concentrations at 5 cm sediment depth. Compaction of sediment cores by water level lowering increased bulk density and maintained high water contents. This side effect, retarding the drying of the sediment surface, was possibly relevant for the GHG net emission of the sediments in Phase II and III. Overall, GHG fluxes from the sediments exhibited high sensitivity to falling water levels. This study suggests that drying pond sediments have great potential to emit large amounts of GHGs to the atmosphere in the event of drought, representing hot spots of GHGs in the landscape."

    "title": "The Freundlich isotherm equation best represents phosphate sorption across soil orders and land use types in tropical soils of Puerto Rico",
    "abstract": "Biomass production in the lowland wet tropical forest is greater than in any other biome, and it is typically limited by soil phosphorus (P) availability. However, the mechanisms involved in the P cycle remain poorly represented in Earth System Models (ESMs). Soil P sorption processes are key in the P cycle and for understanding the extent of P limitation for plant productivity. Currently, a few ESMs include isotherm equations to model these processes. Although the Langmuir equation is widely cited, other isotherm equations may better describe sorption in tropical soils. Here, we use a diverse range of soil samples from Puerto Rico to test the validity of the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin equation. We found that across four soil orders (Inceptisols, Mollisols, Oxisols, Ultisols), and forested and cultivated land use types, the Freundlich equation best represented soil P sorption. Furthermore, the Langmuir and the Temkin equations poorly represent soil P adsorption, especially at low P concentrations. Specifically, the Langmuir equation underestimated soil P adsorption by 40% and the Temkin equation overestimated adsorption by 76%. We also found, as expected, that soil clay content and pH were the most important parameters explaining the variability of the Freundlich ( K f ) constant. Greater clay content and lower pH, common in highly weathered Ultisols and Oxisols which are abundant in the tropics, led to greater K f values. Overall, our results suggest that a diversity of soils can prompt underestimation of P sorption when using the Langmuir isotherm, which leads to an overestimation of available P that can have repercussions on ESM predictions of the P cycle and tropical forest productivity."

    "abstract": "Bransfield Strait has been identified as a climate hotspot for understanding regional environmental changes with global impact. This study focuses on enhancing the understanding of carbon cycle dynamics and its interactions with hydrographic variables in Bransfield Strait, located on the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The stable carbon isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 C DIC ) were investigated in the study region during comprehensive sampling in 2023 along the major ocean basins. Bransfield Strait is influenced by two main source water masses: the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which intrudes into the region from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current meander, and Dense Shelf Water (DSW), which is advected by coastal currents from the Weddell Sea continental shelf. The study reveals CDW’s dominant role in 2023, accounting for ~60% of the water mass mixture in the region and limiting the highest contribution of DSW to the deep layer of the central basin. The spatial variation of δ 13 C DIC signatures showed that biogeochemical processes predominantly shape the δ 13 C DIC distribution along the water column. Photosynthesis enriched the surface waters with the heavier carbon isotope, with signatures ranging from 2 to 1.5‰, while organic matter remineralization depleted it below the mixed layer (ranging from 0 to − 2‰). Horizontally, δ 13 C DIC distribution was influenced by the higher contribution of each source water mass. Thermodynamic fractionation contributed to the enrichment of δ 13 C DIC (~ 1 to 1.5‰) in the CDW layer in Bransfield Strait. Conversely, the predominance of younger and colder DSW exhibited a depletion of δ 13 C DIC (− 1 to − 2‰). Therefore, δ 13 C DIC is identified as an additional tracer to provide new insights into the biogeochemical and hydrodynamic processes of Bransfield Strait."

    "abstract": "Understanding the effects of prescribed burning management practices in combination with anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition on soil carbon (C) storage capacity is of crucial importance in Mediterranean mountain shrublands. To address this issue, an experiment was conducted to assess the effects of prescribed burning (Burn, B / No Burn, NB), N additions (0, 15, and 50 kg N·ha −1 ·year −1 , N0, N15, N50) and their interactive effects on various soil parameters in a shrubland located in the mountain range of Madrid over 2-year period. The results of the study confirmed that both low-intensity prescribed burning and short-term N additions did not alter the C stocks in the soil and floor shrubs. Furthermore, the combination of these two factors did not lead to an increase in soil C accumulation. However, the prescribed fire treatment caused divergent responses in soil parameters and fluxes. Specifically, it caused transient changes including decreased soil respiration (Rs), alterations in the soil microbial community, increased soil water content, temperature, and soil pH, and changes in NH 4 , NH 3 , and available P. Moreover, the cumulative amount of N added gradually depressed Rs, and microbial biomass. Additionally, the interaction between prescribed burning and N fertilisation did not modify the effects associated with fire. The findings indicate that prescribed burning, as implemented in the experiment, can be effectively employed in Mediterranean shrublands, as it did not significantly affect soil C storage under both current and future N deposition scenarios."

The Amazon floodplain is one of the largest tropical wetlands with seasonally flooded forests representing up to 80% of the area of aquatic habitats in the lowland Amazon. Hence, we measured methane oxidation rates (Mox) in two different flooded forests ( várzea , in white waters; igapó , in black waters) and evaluated effects of dissolved oxygen and CH 4 concentrations, and water temperature on methane oxidation. We found high Mox in near-bottom waters associated with high CH 4 concentrations (1.0–2.4 µM) and hypoxia, with volumetric rates ranging from 9.8 to 73 mg C m −3 d −1 in the igapó , and from 2.3 to 101.4 mg C m −3 d −1 in the várzea . Depth integrated Mox rates ranged from 177 to 213 mg C m −2 d −1 for the igapó , and 159 mg C m −2 d −1 in the várzea , and were one to two orders of magnitude higher than CH 4 fluxes from water to the atmosphere, emphasizing the important role of Mox in attenuating CH 4 emissions from tropical flooded forests. The present study contributes to understanding of the complex processes involved in carbon dynamics on tropical floodplains."

    "abstract": "As with most aquatic ecosystems, reservoirs play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle and emit greenhouse gases (GHG) as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). However, GHG emissions from reservoirs are poorly quantified, especially in temperate systems, resulting in high uncertainty. We compared reservoir C emission estimates and uncertainty of diffusive, ebullitive, and degassing pathways in six hydropower reservoirs in the southeastern United States among four data sources: two field-based surveys and two models (including the GHG Reservoir “G-res” Tool). We found that CH 4 diffusion was most similar across data sources (modeled minus observed, bias = − 21 g CO 2-eq m −2 y −1 ) and had low relative uncertainty (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.98). On the other hand, CO 2 diffusion was least consistent across data sources (bias = − 518 g CO 2-eq m −2 y −1 ). Both field surveys indicated strong negative CO 2 diffusion (i.e., CO 2 uptake) at all reservoirs, while G-res estimated positive CO 2 diffusion. By extension, total C emissions showed similar discrepancies, leading to high uncertainty in upscaling and interpreting reservoir source-sink dynamics. Finally, CH 4 ebullition had the highest relative uncertainty (CV = 2.77) due to high variability across sites. We discuss limitations of field surveys and these models, including temperature-based annualization methods, varying definitions of ebullition zones, low sampling resolution, and lack of dynamism. Future field efforts focused on capturing variability in CO 2 diffusion and CH 4 ebullition will be especially valuable in reducing uncertainty and improving models to advance our understanding reservoir GHG emissions."

    "title": "Ebullition dominates high methane emissions globally across all lake sizes",
    "abstract": "Methane is emitted from lakes by diffusion and ebullition. Methane diffusion is constrained by diffusion from sediments to water and water to the atmosphere, as well as oxidation. Methane ebullition from shallow water sediments bypasses these constraints but requires high methane production to form bubbles. We tested if ebullition dominates at high emissions with a Danish dataset and a global dataset comprising 973 measurements. Upper limits of methane diffusion were more constrained than ebullition. During periods of low total emissions, diffusive methane emissions predominated, whereas ebullition prevailed during periods of high emissions. The relative contribution of ebullition changed predictably, being 50% at 1.5–1.6 mmol m −2 d −1 and 75% at 5.1–6.4 mmol m −2 d −1 total methane emission. The probability of ebullitive flux was highly affected by the magnitude of the diffusive flux, and water temperature. Thus, when data was divided into the water temperature intervals ≤10, 10–20, and >20 °C, ebullition occurred in 69, 69 and 95% of the observations, respectively, and emission increased from 0.29, 0.71 to 3.6 mmol m −2 d −1 between the three temperature intervals. Summed across all measurements, ebullition accounted for the majority (75–83%) of total methane emissions. Thus, to attain reliable whole-lake emission and global estimates, many ebullition measurements are required to cover their extensive spatial and temporal variability."

    "abstract": "In seasonally snow-covered ecosystems such as northern hardwood forests of the northeastern U.S., spring snowmelt is a critical transition period for plant and microbial communities, as well as for the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N). However, it remains unknown how shifting snowmelt dynamics influence soil and plant processing and uptake of N in these forests, which are experiencing reductions in N availability relative to demand, a process known as oligotrophication. We characterized the role of changing spring snowmelt timing on root production and N pools and fluxes by manipulating snowmelt timing along a climate elevation gradient at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. We manually halved or doubled snow water equivalent (SWE) in experimental plots in March of 2022 and 2023 to accelerate or delay by an average of one week, respectively, the onset of spring snowmelt. Earlier snowmelt led to reduced snowpack depth and duration, as well as deeper, more sustained soil frost during the snowmelt period in 2022, but soil freezing did not occur in 2023. Soil nitrate and net nitrification rates were significantly lower with shallower snowpack and earlier snowmelt compared to plots with deeper snow and later snowmelt. Shallower snowpack and early snowmelt were also associated with decreased foliar N concentrations and δ 15 N values, indications that earlier snowmelt contributes to lower N availability relative to plant N uptake and demand. Our study provides evidence that early snowmelt resulting from shallower snowpack contributes to N oligotrophication, primarily through impacts on soil nitrate supply and uptake of N by trees."

Teeth, the deepest internal skeletal structures in the individual and vital for feeding, showed the greatest compositional variation at the nanoscale, whereas tests and spines were both more consistent in Mg concentrations. Mg incorporation is, approximately, a function of proximity to seawater, with levels highest in layers further away from the marine environment. Body part variation within individuals of a populations was relatively low (Maximum SD x̄ = ± 0.19 wt% MgCO 3 , n = 9) while average variation was ± 0.14 wt% MgCO 3 (n = 670), reflecting genetic variability. Population variation across a range of latitudes indicated both well-known and novel environmental influences. Skeletal mineralogy in a population in Tauranga, North Island, New Zealand at 38°S (mean = 8.5, SD = 0.07, n = 50) is significantly different (p < 0.0001) from a population in Timaru, South Island, New Zealand at 44°S (mean = 8.2, SD = 0.07, n = 62). Populations across the country showed that external parts (spines) were most affected by temperature and classical environmental factors, while internal parts (Aristotle’s lanterns) were not swayed by abiotic factors. Intermediate structures (tests) were unexpectedly influenced by wave energy, where increases in Mg content among populations was correlated to higher wave-energy beaches. While intrinsic, phylogenetic, and extrinsic factors can individually influence skeletal carbonate mineralogy, these data show that accounting for the cumulative individual- and population-level factors affecting mineralogy provides an extremely nuanced understanding of biomineralization within a single species."

    "abstract": "The Caribbean region is experiencing seasonal inundation of the shoreline by large mats of pelagic Sargassum spp. (Sargassum) leading to novel impacts to ecological communities. Where Sargassum becomes trapped along the shoreline, leachates turn the water a brown color, coined Sargassum Brown Tide (Sbt). We conducted monthly sampling at six sites along the offshore mangrove keys of Jobos Bay, PR between April 2022 to July 2023 to collect temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (chl a), total suspended solids (TSS), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) at nearshore, midshore, and offshore zones along transects running perpendicular to the shoreline. We also collected data on submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) community dynamics along transects at each site. We found significantly higher chl a and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations within the nearshore zone during Sbt events but the differences did not extend out to the midshore and offshore zones. Total suspended solids were also higher at nearshore zones compared to offshore zones when a Sbt event occurred. In addition, sites that experienced Sbt had higher turbidity and lower pH. Total percent cover of SAV was different between sites impacted by Sbt and control sites depending on transect zone, with higher SAV percent cover for control sites within the 5 m zone and often within the 15 m zone. Our data suggest that Sbt has significant impacts to nearshore water quality, chl a, and SAV percent cover; however, most impacts are not seen beyond 45 m in well flushed systems."

    "title": "Effects of forest-floor litter manipulations on soil organic carbon pools in a temperate mixed forest: a stoichiometric perspective",
    "abstract": "Litter traits are closely associated with soil organic carbon (SOC) persistence. However, quantified effects of litter quality and quantity on SOC formation and loss are still debated, as they depend on complex biotic and abiotic interactions. Specifically, it remains unclear how the elemental (e.g., carbon [C] and nitrogen [N]) stoichiometry impacts the SOC pool through its control over nutrient cycling and energy flow. Here, we quantified the variations in bulk SOC and its fractionations (particulate organic carbon [POC], mineral-associated organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon [MBC]) under different litter treatments varying in quality and quantity, using a 13-year detrital manipulation experiment in a temperate mixed forest. We found that double mixed litter input increased bulk SOC pool by 58.5%, with a 67.2% increase in POC at 0–10 cm depth. Litter removal reduced POC by 40.4% (0–10 cm) and 49.8% (10–20 cm). Notably, litter removal and double woody litter input reduced the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) of bulk soil, particulate and mineral-associated fractions, but had no effect on the microbial biomass C:N. The MBC was positively correlated with POC and soil moisture at 0–10 cm depth. Our findings indicate that litter quantity dominates SOC dynamics by regulating POC. Double mixed litter exhibited non-additive effects on SOC formation, likely due to trade-offs between fresh C inputs and priming-induced C losses. While litter removal reduced the soil C:N, microbial biomass C:N was unchanged, suggesting the need for longer-term studies to understand these decoupled responses."

    "abstract": "Black carbon has been shown to suppress microbial methane production by promoting anaerobic oxidation of organic carbon, diverting electrons from methanogenesis. This finding represents a new process through which black carbon, such as wildfire char and biochar, can impact the climate. However, the mechanism and capacity of black carbon to support metabolism remained unclear. We hypothesized black carbon could support microbial growth exclusively through its electron storage capacity (ESC). The electron contents of a wood biochar was quantified through redox titration with titanium(III) citrate before and after Geobacter metallireducens growth, with acetate as an electron donor and air-oxidized biochar as an electron acceptor. Cell number increased 42-fold, from 2.8(± 0.6) × 10 8 to 1.17(± 0.14) × 10 10 , in 8 days based on fluorescent cell counting and the result was confirmed by qPCR. The qPCR results also showed that most cells existed in suspension, whereas cell attachment to biochar was minimal. Graphite, which conducts but does not store electrons, did not support growth. Through electron balance and use of singly 13 C-labeled acetate ( 13 CH 3 COO – ), we showed (1) G. metallireducens could use 0.86 mmol/g, or ~ 19%, of the biochar's ESC for growth, (2) 84% and 16% of the acetate was consumed for energy and biosynthesis, respectively, during biochar respiration and (3) ca . 80 billion electrons were deposited into biochar for each cell produced. This is the first study to establish electron balance for microbial respiration of black carbon and to quantitatively determine the mechanism and capacity of biochar-supported growth.

    "title": "Impact of environmental disturbances on hydrology and nitrogen cycling in Central European forest catchments",
    "abstract": "Climate-related events and bark beetle outbreaks influenced hydrological dynamics and nitrogen cycling in three Central European forest catchments in the GEOMON network. Since 1994, distinct environmental phases were observed at studied catchments. Initially, nitrate (NO 3 ⁻ ) concentrations declined at Anenský potok and Polomka due to reduced acid deposition, while remaining stable at Pluhův bor. From 2015 onwards, drought and extensive spruce dieback caused significant hydrological disruptions, including over a 200% increase in runoff at Anenský potok. In contrast, moderated hydrological impacts due to differences in the evapotranspiration-to-precipitation ratio was observed at Polomka. At Pluhův bor, gradual deforestation combined with climate change effects, such as rising temperatures and decreasing precipitation, resulted in stable runoff compared to the abrupt changes in the other two catchments. Despite these differences, disturbances across all catchments intensified nitrate leaching and disrupted nitrogen retention. This led to substantial dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export, particularly at Polomka, which is characterized by a low soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N). These findings highlight the vulnerability of forest ecosystems to nitrogen loss under environmental stressors and underscore the importance of effective management strategies to mitigate nitrogen cycle disruptions in the context of ongoing climate change."

    "abstract": "We evaluated base cations, Al, Fe, Mn, REEs, DOC, anions, and P mobilization during three discharge events (E-1, E-2, E-3) at the headwater catchment W-9, Sleepers River, Vermont, USA. Peak discharge ranged from 3.696 (E-1) to 0.073 (E-3) mm h −1 . Eight samples from each event were speciated for total (unfiltered-acidified) and dissolved (0.45 µm filtered-acidified). During E-1, total Al, Fe, and Mn increased to maxima of 376 (1790X), 161 (194X), and 38 (45X) µmol L −1 , respectively. Concurrently, total La, Ce, Pr, and Nd increased to maxima of 87 (590X), 114 (671X), 15 (375X), and 53 (408X) nmol L −1 , respectively, greatly exceeding the dissolved fraction. Totals for Er > Yb > Tm > Lu reached comparable enrichments near or at maximum discharge. Discharge ranged from 0.41 to 0.94 mm h −1 during E-2, a snowmelt event. Total Al was comparatively stable; total Fe and Mn increased 15X and 79X, remaining less than total Al. Total La, Ce, Pr, and Nd peaked with total Fe and Mn. E-3, a late summer rain, resembled E-1 but had much lower maxima for all REEs, P, Al, Fe, and Mn. Particulate, total, and dissolved REEs and P correlated with DOC and with total Al, Fe, and Mn over all discharges, with molar Al > Fe > Mn (most samples) for E-1 and E-3. Maximum total and dissolved P declined from 15.4 and 0.89 (E-1) to 0.98 and 0.27 µmol L −1 (E-3), respectively. Particulate REEs correlated strongly (R 2 = 0.95–0.96) with Al, Fe, and Mn particulates eroded from the stream bed and continuously precipitated during and after high discharge of groundwater."

    "title": "Arctic willow (Salix polaris) exudation as a driver of microbial activity and soil formation in the high arctic tundra",
    "abstract": "Colonization by pioneer plants, among which the arctic willow ( Salix polaris ) is one of the most important, accelerates soil development after deglaciation. This is achieved through the increased input of organic matter from plant biomass and the exudation of low molecular mass organic compounds (LMMOA), predominantly organic acids, which facilitate mineral dissolution and nutrient release. These exudates support microbial activity and contribute to the formation of soil organic matter. While there is quite a lot of data on the exudation and acceleration of microbial activity in the rhizosphere of various plants, similar data concerning arctic plants, including willow, are scarce. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the effect of C, N, P root stoichiometry on nutrient content in exudates and the rhizosphere microbiome during soil succession after deglaciation. In this study, we analysed various habitats of high-arctic tundra in Petuniabukta (Billefjorden, Svalbard), representing different stages of vegetation development. Our objectives were (i) to assess soil and rhizosphere carbon and nutrient content and availability, as well as microbial biomass CNP; (ii) to evaluate the rhizosphere effect on nutrient availability and the microbiome of arctic willow; and (iii) to measure root and exudation CNP and quality, primarily LMMOA, in arctic willow from the studied habitats. The exudates released to deionised water were analysed for LMMOA and inorganic anions (ion chromatography) as well as the total content of C and N. The plants roots were analysed for CNP content. Soil chemical properties (e.g. pH, organic C, total and exchangeable content of elements, water extractable PO 4 3− ) and microbial parameters (microbial biomass and quantity of bacteria and fungi) were assessed in both rhizosphere and bulk soils, with the rhizosphere effect calculated accordingly. The most abundant LMMOA species in willow exudates were lactate, acetate, formate, malate and citrate, followed by pyruvate, quinate and oxalate, collectively representing approximately 2% of the total exuded C. The rhizosphere effect of willows on nutrient availability and microbial parameters was the most significant at sites with early soil development and diminished with increasing vegetation cover. A link was observed between nitrogen and phosphorus exudation and plant root stoichiometry. These trends underscored the essential role of root exudation in overcoming microbial nutrient limitations during early soil development, particularly in sites with lower nitrogen availability by reducing the soil C/N ratio."

    "abstract": "Flocculation of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) in estuaries is crucial for transforming and removing terrestrial carbon inputs across the land-to-ocean aquatic continuum. We measured variations in chromophoric DOM (CDOM) absorption and fluorescence of riverine DOM through mixing experiments conducted across various seasons and environments, identifying patterns in salt-induced flocculation. Our observations show a systematic reduction in CDOM absorption in the 250–450 nm range at salinity 2, with a sharper decrease at higher wavelengths. Flocculation led to decreased relative fluorescence intensity below emission wavelength of 360 nm and an increased intensity at higher emission wavelengths across the excitation spectrum measured (250–450 nm). We introduce a new metric, red shift ratio , a fluorescence-based metric calculated as the ratio of emission intensity at 300–350 nm to that at 360–500 nm, at excitation wavelengths between 250 and 300 nm, for detecting flocculation-induced changes in CDOM across estuarine systems. The observed sensitivity of CDOM to flocculation in low salinities challenges its use as a conservative tracer in coastal gradients, suggesting that recalibrations are required for remote sensing algorithms and carbon flux estimations across land-sea continuum, particularly in systems with similar characteristics."

    "title": "Estimating fractions of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification using data assimilation",
    "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions play a significant role in global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. Nitrification and denitrification represent the primary pathways of N 2 O emissions in agroecosystems. However, modelling the responses of nitrification, denitrification, and subsequent N 2 O emissions to soil conditions and nitrification inhibitors remains challenging, as the fractions of N 2 O emissions derived from nitrification and denitrification used in model simulations cannot be directly measured. In this study, we estimated soil nitrification, denitrification, N 2 O emissions, and their related parameters via data assimilation under various soil moisture levels [water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 50% and 70%], incubation temperature (15, 25 and 35 °C) and nitrification inhibitor application (DMPP, 3MPTZ and C 2 H 2 ) in cereal and vegetable production systems in Australia. We found that the contribution of nitrification to N 2 O emissions (i.e., the fraction of N 2 O emitted from nitrification, \\({f}_{{\\text{N}}_2{\\text{O}}\\_nit}\\) ) decreased with increasing temperature and moisture content, whereas denitrification dominated N 2 O production (i.e., the fraction of N 2 O emitted from denitrification, \\({f}_{N2O\\_dni}\\) ) under 70% WFPS regardless of temperatures. Under fertilizer N application, the use of nitrification inhibitors decreased \\({f}_{{\\text{N}}_2{\\text{O}}\\_nit}\\) but increased \\({f}_{N2O\\_dni}\\) . The efficacy of nitrification inhibitors in mitigating N 2 O emissions varied with environmental conditions. In this study, we demonstrate the use of data assimilation to constrain key parameters for predicting nitrification, denitrification and associated N 2 O emissions in response to soil environments and management practices. Integrating this technique into ecosystem process-based models has the potential to enhance model accuracy by reducing uncertainties and biases."

    "title": "Plant nitrogen demand, not soil carbon availability, decouples net mineralization and nitrification following forest canopy disturbances",
    "abstract": "Nitrification is a key biogeochemical process, with higher rates indicative of higher soil nitrogen availability and potential nitrogen losses from soils to waterways and the atmosphere. Heterotrophic microbes and plants compete with nitrifiers for mineralized nitrogen, thereby influencing the fraction of ammonium converted by nitrifiers to nitrate. Higher soil carbon availability fuels heterotrophic microbial ammonium demand, which can weaken the positive relationship between net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification by limiting ammonium supply to nitrifiers. Whether soil carbon availability remains a central control on the coupling of these processes under altered plant nitrogen demand remains relatively unexplored even as disturbances that reduce plant biomass increase globally. Using partially disturbed forests that vary in aboveground biomass and soil carbon availability, we test the generalizability of microbially available carbon as a control on the coupling of net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification. We analyze differences between harvested and unharvested forest stands, changes over time since harvest, and the effects of retained overstory trees. Higher levels of disturbance consistently strengthened the positive relationship between net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification. Yet reduced plant biomass, rather than microbially available carbon, primarily mediated the coupling of these processes. Our findings suggest that plant-mediated nitrogen demand can be a stronger control on the decoupling of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification than heterotrophic soil microbes following partial canopy disturbances. These results have important implications for understanding coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in forests globally, highlighting a need to consider how shifting disturbance regimes could influence controls on nitrification."

    "title": "Impact of river reconnection for coastal restoration on nitrate reduction in brackish marsh soils and bay-bottom sediments in coastal Louisiana, USA",
    "abstract": "Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, including improving surface water quality through nutrient removal. Louisiana has experienced ~ 4800 km 2 of coastal wetland loss between 1932 and 2016 due to high relative sea level rise and reduced sediment from the Mississippi River due to levees. The 2023 LA Coastal Master Plan aims to restore Louisiana’s degraded coastline through restoration projects, including sediment diversions or river reconnection. The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion Project will reconnect the river sediment-laden water with the coastal wetlands of Barataria Basin to nourish degrading marshes. However, the diversion will also deliver substantial nitrate (NO 3 − ) to the basin, potentially negatively impacting water quality. We quantified NO 3 − reduction rates at these high (2 mg/L) and low (0.5 mg/L) water column concentrations for marsh and submerged estuarine sediments using intact cores and a laboratory incubation. An additional treatment where 2 cm of mineral river sediment was placed over the organic marsh soil as a future, post-diversion scenario to simulate sediment deposition on the marsh once the river is reconnected. We hypothesized that NO 3 − reduction rates would decrease once mineral sediment is deposited on the organic marsh soil. For an aerobic water column, nitrate reduction rates for the vegetated marsh, post-diversion marsh, submerged eroded marsh, and estuarine sediment zones were 71.1 ± 2.7, 27.8 ± 4.5, 19.7 ± 1.2, and 13.0 ± 0.75 mg N m −2 d −1 , respectively. Thus, the post-diversion marsh NO 3 − reduction rate decreased by ~ 60% compared to the current vegetated marsh. However, we predict the newly deposited sediment will increase NO 3 − removal by 1.17 × in the eroded marsh and estuarine sediment zones, which are always flooded and will receive river sediment. The marsh is only flooded 31–48% of the time, lessening the impact of the reduction. These findings can improve predictive water quality models used to assess nutrient loading and fate more accurately across the basin under the river reconnection scenario and inform other deltaic regions as freshwater flows are restored to coastal systems globally."

    "abstract": "The signaling compound nitric oxide (NO) might play an important, yet unquantified role in mediating soil biogeochemical Carbon and Nitrogen cycles. This study quantified the effects of different soil-typical exogenous NO concentrations on the microbial community, on fertilizer N turnover, and on C and N trace gas fluxes of agricultural soil. For this, we repeatedly established soil NO concentrations of either 0, 200, 400, and ppbv˗NO in soil mesocosms for in total of 12 days, followed by high-resolution automated measurements of CO 2 , NO, CH 4 , and N 2 O fluxes, molecular analysis of microbial community composition and 15 N-isotope-tracing based assessment of fertilizer N turnover. We found no effects of different NO levels on microbial communities and CO 2 , CH 4 , and NO fluxes. However, at 200 ppbv concentration, exogenous NO promoted microbial assimilation of fertilizer N. In contrast, at 400 ppbv˗NO concentration, microbial biomass N was reduced, and microbial uptake of fertilizer N was inhibited, accompanied by a 33% reduction of N 2 O emissions. This suggested a promoting effect of 200 ppbv˗NO on the physiology of cells involved in heterotrophic microbial N turnover, probably reinforcing the role of cell-endogenous NO. In contrast, the higher exogenous NO concentrations of 400 ppbv seemed to inhibit heterotrophic microbial inorganic N assimilation, with however no increase in N 2 O emissions due to detoxification mechanisms. In conclusion, our pioneering study provides first insights into impacts of exogenous NO on soil C and N biogeochemistry in natural soil systems and reveals a NO concentration-dependent regulation of microbial N retention."

    "title": "River management and excessive nitrate loading influence nitrate uptake in a large transboundary oligotrophic river",
    "abstract": "Biologically available nitrogen from human activities have altered nutrient dynamics across landscapes and aquatic ecosystems. Small spatial changes in land use and river management, may contribute to altered nutrient dynamics and influence denitrification and assimilatory uptake in river systems. Human actions can influence the stoichiometry of rivers. Construction of Libby Dam and the creation of the transboundary Koocanusa Reservoir has resulted in sequestration of approximately 60%–80% of the phosphorus entering the reservoir. Recent and ongoing expansion of surficial mining operations in one tributary upstream of Koocanusa Reservoir, the Elk River, has increased nitrate loading tenfold or more to Koocanusa Reservoir and to the Kootenai River. The combination of excessive nitrate loading and decreased phosphorus availability has skewed the N:P ratio to greater than 200:1 in both the river and reservoir. To address how this altered stoichiometry influences nitrogen spiraling in a large river, we estimated nitrate uptake over 16 years in five reaches of the Kootenai River. Reaches spanned 224 river km and types were based on natural and anthropogenically-influenced geomorphology. Although we documented a decline in nitrate moving longitudinally downstream indicating that nitrate is being used by the biota, the magnitude and timing of areal nitrate uptake varies among the reaches. Areal nitrate uptake did not differ between the early years with lower nitrate concentrations and the later years with higher nitrate concentrations suggesting that the Kootenai River is nitrogen saturated. Phosphorus addition, used as a management tool to offset P sequestration in the reservoir, increased areal nitrate uptake and extended the period of higher areal nitrate uptake. Without increases to the ecosystem functions of nitrogen transformation and removal, the ecosystem becomes saturated and the entire load is being transported downstream."

    "title": "Ironing out the question: what is limiting cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes in the Prairie Pothole Region?",
    "abstract": "The Canadian Prairie Pothole Region is a notable hotspot for cyanobacteria-dominated lakes. This study found minor variations in cyanobacterial genera across these lakes yet observed significant differences in standing biomass, as the lakes ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic classifications. A correlational analysis of nutrients, specifically total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) revealed that the limiting nutrients varied considerably across the region. Of the lakes studied, cyanobacterial biomass was P-limited in 21 lakes, N-limited in 3 lakes, and co-limited by both P and N in 23 lakes. Surprisingly, in 32 lakes, the biomass was limited by neither P nor N. In these lakes, iron (Fe) emerged as the most likely limiting nutrient, given a relatively narrow range of free ferric Fe (pFe) between 18 and 26. Cyanobacteria can create biomass under Fe stress by producing Fe-scavenging siderophores that target pFe. However, in neither P- nor N-limited lakes, there was a lack of correlation between siderophore concentrations and cyanobacterial biomass (r = 0.05), indicating that the siderophores were unable to scavenge Fe and thereby utilize the available P and N to produce further cyanobacterial biomass. Our findings suggest that these Fe-starved eutrophic lakes exhibited a paradox of slow-growing yet high cyanobacterial biomass, challenging the notion that only oligotrophic lakes embody slow-growing metabolisms. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering nutrient limitations on cyanobacterial growth and incorporating macro- (P and N) and micro- (Fe) nutrient limitation considerations into existing nutrient management strategies to mitigate cyanobacterial dominance effectively."

    "title": "A soil structure-based modeling approach to soil heterotrophic respiration",
    "abstract": "Soil microbial communities play a pivotal role in controlling soil carbon cycling and its climate feedback. Accurately predicting microbial respiration in soils has been challenged by the intricate resource heterogeneity of soil systems. This makes it difficult to formulate mathematical expressions for carbon fluxes at the soil bulk scale which are fundamental for soil carbon models. Recent advances in characterizing and modeling soil heterogeneity are promising. Yet they have been independent of soil structure characterizations, hence increasing the number of empirical parameters needed to model microbial processes. Soil structure, intended as the aggregate and pore size distributions, is, in fact, a key contributor to soil organization and heterogeneity and is related to the presence of microsites and associated environmental conditions in which microbial communities are active. In this study, we present a theoretical framework that accounts for the effects of microsites heterogeneity on microbial activity by explicitly linking heterogeneity to the distribution of aggregate sizes and their resources. From the soil aggregate size distribution, we derive a mathematical expression for heterotrophic respiration that accounts for soil biogeochemical heterogeneity through measurable biophysical parameters. The expression readily illustrates how various soil heterogeneity scenarios impact respiration rates. In particular, we compare heterogeneous with homogeneous scenarios for the same total carbon substrate and microbial biomass and identify the conditions under which respiration in heterogeneous soils (soils having non-uniform distribution of carbon substrate and microbial biomass carbon across different aggregate size classes) differs from homogeneous soils (soils having uniform distribution of carbon substrate and microbial biomass carbon across different aggregate size classes). The proposed framework may allow a simplified representation of dynamic microbial processes in soil carbon models across different land uses and land covers, key factors affecting soil structure."

    "abstract": "We have investigated the bacterial decomposition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from the organic layer of a boreal forest soil and filtered at a pore size of 0.2 µm. This DOM source has previously been extensively characterized and contains approximately equal amounts by carbon of a colloidal fraction, mainly composed of carbohydrates, and a fraction of molecularly dissolved DOM. Here, extracts were inoculated with soil bacteria and the decomposition of DOM was followed over a period of 2 months, during which it was analyzed with scattering methods and 1 H NMR, and by measuring the concentration of total organic carbon. A comparison was also made with dialyzed extract. Results showed that while the bacteria fully decomposed the molecular fraction within approximately two weeks, the colloidal fraction was stable with no visible decomposition within the 2 months. The results indicate the importance of distinguishing small molecules from colloidal aggregates in decomposition studies, and demonstrate the usefulness of combining scattering methods with 1 H NMR for this purpose."

Significant long-term trends in solute concentrations within a subset of the catchments were consistent with recovery from atmospheric deposition (e.g., calcium, nitrate, sulfate) and increased precipitation (e.g., dissolved organic carbon). Lack of evidence for multi-decadal trends in most catchments suggests resilience of northern temperate ecosystems or that subtle net effects of simultaneous changes in climate and disturbance regimes do not result in directional trends. Synchronous seasonal oscillations of solute concentrations occurred across many catchments, reflecting shared climate and biotic drivers of seasonality within the northern temperate zone. Despite shared patterns among catchments at a seasonal scale, multi-scale temporal patterns were statistically distinct among even adjacent headwater catchments, implying that local attributes of headwater catchments modify the signals imparted by atmospheric phenomena and regional disturbances. To effectively characterize hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to changing climate and disturbance regimes, catchment monitoring programs could include multiple streams with contributing areas that encompass regional heterogeneity in vegetation, topography, and elevation. Overall, detection of long-term patterns and trends requires monitoring multiple catchments at a frequency that captures periodic variation (e.g., seasonality) and a duration encompassing the perturbations of interest."

    "title": "Stream C to N to P ratios aligned with microbial needs enhance biofilm nitrate uptake and subsequent nitrogen loss",
    "abstract": "Anthropogenic inputs of reactive nitrogen (N) elevate nitrate–N (NO 3 -N) levels in streams, potentially shifting their dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to N to phosphorus (P) ratios (DOC:N:P) toward N excess. Meanwhile, changes in riparian vegetation can alter light availability. Together, these factors may influence NO 3 -N uptake by photoautotrophs and heterotrophs in surface (benthic) biofilms and by heterotrophs in subsurface (hyporheic) biofilms. Although these compartments may exhibit distinct rates and constraints on nutrient uptake and retention, the extent to which stoichiometric imbalances and light availability govern their macronutrient uptake remains largely unexplored. Here, we present results from a stream mesocosm experiment in which light availability and DOC:N:P were manipulated by adding labile DOC and inorganic P to create a physiologically more balanced stoichiometric composition of stream mesocosm water. We show (I) how the relative (macronutrient ratio) and absolute (particulate organic C, particulate N, and particulate P) macronutrient composition of benthic and hyporheic biofilms changes with different levels of light availability (20 and 90 µmol photons m −2 s −1 ) and different water DOC:N:P (350:940:1 and 73:40:1), (II) that benthic NO 3 -N uptake rates increased with addition of labile DOC and P, whereas light had only a minor effect, and (III) that higher NO 3 -N uptake rates due to labile DOC and P addition in benthic biofilms leads to higher N loss from biofilm biomass. This results in similar N retention times across treatments and highlights the importance of water column macronutrient stoichiometry as a predictor of in-stream N cycling."

    "title": "Springtime soil and tree stem greenhouse gas fluxes and the related soil microbiome pattern in a drained peatland forest",
    "abstract": "Spring can be a critical time of year for stem and soil methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions as soil freeze–thaw events can be hot moments of gas release. Greenhouse gas fluxes from soil, Downy birch ( Betula pubescens ) and Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) stems were quantified using chamber systems and gas analysers in spring 2023 in a northern drained peatland forest. Dissolved gas concentrations in birch sap and soil water, environmental parameters, soil chemistry, and functional gene abundances in the soil were determined. During spring, initially low soil and stem CH 4 , N 2 O, and CO 2 emissions increased towards late April. Temperature emerged as the primary driver of soil and stem fluxes, alongside photosynthetically active radiation influencing stem fluxes. Soil hydrologic conditions had minimal short-term impact. No clear evidence linked stem CH 4 emissions to birch sap gas concentrations, while relationships existed for CO 2 . Functional gene abundances of the N and CH 4 -cycles changed between measurement days. Potential for methanogenesis and complete denitrification was higher under elevated soil water content, shifting to methanotrophy and incomplete denitrification as the study progressed. However, our results highlight the need for further analysis of relationships between microbial cycles and GHG fluxes under different environmental conditions, including identifying soil microbial processes in soil layers where tree roots absorb water."

    "abstract": "Decomposition of organic compounds in peat soils requires atmospheric oxygen, which is limited when water fills soil pore spaces. We examined the thermodynamics of organic matter decomposition in Austrian peatlands and predicted greater thermodynamic constraints deeper in the soil profile where pore spaces are water filled. For mire types with stagnant water we hypothesize that thermodynamic closure of the pore space will occur deeper in the soil profile and there will be a greater extent of organic matter transformation. In this study peat cores from eight different peatlands were collected and analysed for their Gibbs free energy of formation ( \\(\\Delta {\\text{G}}_{{\\text{f}}}\\) ), carbon oxidation state (C ox ), and degree of unsaturation (Ω). The experimental design included bogs and fens, as well as natural and degraded sites. The study showed that decomposition of organic matter was greater in fens and degraded sites than in bogs and undisturbed sites, respectively, and there was a consistent increase in Ω with depth that marked an evolution away from cellulose-dominated compositions and toward lignin-dominated compositions at depth. These results support our study hypothesis that greater water stagnation in sites results in less transformation and shows that peatlands can be distinguished between the stable and unstable, and by relative recalcitrance."

    "title": "Geochemical and sediment dynamics during an experimental high flow pulse event on the Allegheny River: Lessons for river system management",
    "abstract": "High flow and flood events are essential for sustaining river ecosystems, driving nutrient cycling, habitat diversity, and species dispersal. However, widespread flow regulation via dams and reservoirs has disrupted natural hydrological processes, leading to river fragmentation and homogenization of flow regimes. While previous research has largely focused on the hydraulic and biological impacts of engineered flow events, less attention has been given to their influence on solute mobilization, transport, and biogeochemical transformations. This study addresses this gap by evaluating the geochemical and sediment dynamics of the first experimental spring high flow event (i.e., pulse event) on the Allegheny River (Pennsylvania, USA), conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the Sustainable Rivers Program. The pulse event, initiated on March 30, 2023, involved a sustained release of 451 cms from Kinzua Dam over 21 h. We hypothesized this experimental spring pulse would mobilize organic-rich sediment and nutrients stored behind Kinzua Dam, while also altering the geochemical signature of downstream waters through interactions with hyporheic zones, sediment scouring, and channel connectivity. To assess these impacts, we collected hourly water grab samples over a 48-h period spanning pre- and post-pulse conditions at multiple downstream locations. Samples were analyzed for dissolved metals, nutrients, total suspended solids, and nitrate isotopes. Results reveal distinct temporal shifts in water chemistry, with observed fluctuations in total suspended solids, dissolved metals, and nutrient concentrations highlighting hydrological connections between the main channel and riparian zones, reinforcing the importance of experimental pulse events in ecosystem restoration. Based on these findings, we propose a conceptual model linking controlled flood pulses to sediment and solute fluxes, which can be tested in other regulated river systems to evaluate the effectiveness of flow restoration strategies. These results provide key insights into the role of controlled high flow pulses in shaping sediment and solute dynamics, filling an important knowledge gap in understanding the biogeochemical implications of large-scale flow experiments."

    "abstract": "Climate warming is increasing thermal stratification depth, strength, and duration in lakes, leading to more frequent hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. Most research has focused on eutrophic temperate lakes, which differ significantly from boreal lakes that dominate Earth’s landscape. However, assessing the impact of hypoxia, confounded by browning, warming, and altered stratification, on biogeochemistry and ecological processes in boreal lakes is particularly challenging. Here, we test how oxygenating a hypoxic hypolimnion affects water chemistry, bacterial and primary production (BP and PP), and detritus degradation in a shallow humic boreal lake divided into two basins in an experimental four-year Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) design. After two control years, we oxygenated the hypolimnion of one basin during two stratified periods without disturbing the seasonal development of the thermocline. Hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations moderately impacted lake biogeochemistry. Reoxygenation altered nitrification pathways (increased NO 3 − ) of the hypolimnion, and slightly decreased epilimnion and lake BP (− 6.1% of annual average) and green tea degradation (− 6.0%), whereas Rooibos degradation slightly increased (7.3%). Other water chemistry parameters remained within natural variation. We compared our BACI approach, which separates natural variation, to the simpler Before vs After approach, which does not. We find that studies not accounting for seasonal and among-year variability may overestimate the effects of oxygenation on hypolimnion biogeochemistry, as much of the observed impact is due to natural climate variation. Climate warming and altered stratification patterns are therefore likely to impact boreal lake algal and bacterial production and degradation more than hypolimnion hypoxia during the stratified period."

    "title": "Mercury cycling in the Czech GEOMON network catchments recovering from acid deposition and facing climate change",
    "abstract": "We used the catchment mass balance approach to investigate mercury (Hg) cycling at the 14 forested GEOMON catchments of the Czech Geological Survey. The temperate forest catchments had variable exposure to historic high sulfur (S) and Hg emissions, and span a range of size and elevation. We monitored monthly Hg inputs (bulk precipitation, throughfall, litterfall) and outputs (stream runoff) during 2020–2022. The catchments spanned a large gradient of historic Hg deposition, but current Hg patterns more closely aligned with catchment factors like local climate, as influenced by elevation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and geology. The dominant pathway of Hg input was litterfall (averaging 44.5 ± 15.7 µg m −2 yr −1 ; > 91% of total input). Two surprising findings were that GEOMON had low Hg concentrations and fluxes in general but had the highest litterfall Hg fluxes in Europe, and these increased even further in forested areas that had bark beetle infestations. Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), measured using passive samplers, was consistently low (1.25 to 1.66 ng m −3 ) across the 14 catchments. Stream Hg output varied across catchments and averaged 1.5 ± 1.7 µg m −2 yr −1 . The average Hg retention rate at the 14 GEOMON catchments, calculated as the fraction of average Hg inputs (throughfall + litterfall) that remained in the catchment and did not run off in streamwater, was 97%. The high catchment Hg retention combined with its strong association with DOC suggests that with climate change intensification of carbon cycling, these catchments will be a Hg source for decades to come."

    "title": "Decoding the hidden mechanisms of soil carbon cycling in response to climate change in a substrate-limited forested ecosystem",
    "abstract": "Climate change is rapidly redefining the biogeochemical dynamics of our planet, particularly in relation to soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and loss. Also, most existing soil warming studies have focused on nutrient-rich soils in temperate and arctic/boreal regions, limiting predictions for the many nutrient-poor tropical/subtropical soils that store a substantial fraction of global soil C. To address this gap, we evaluated the influence of temperature and substrate (C and nutrient) availability on soil C cycling in a nutrient-poor (substrate-limited) subtropical forest, where previous field research suggested mixed warming responses. We aimed to isolate confounding elements and elucidate the principal mechanisms underpinning SOC dynamics under diverse environmental scenarios: warming (ambient at 25° C, + 1.5 °C at 26.5 °C, and + 2.5 °C at 27.5° C), nutrient addition (nitrogen and phosphorus) and carbon addition treatments. Samples were collected from a low-latitude soil warming experiment with subtropical Typic Kanhapludults soil (Whitehall Forest, Athens, Georgia). Under laboratory conditions, we incubated soil samples for 22 days at the temperatures recorded during sample collection in the field. We looked at key elements of the soil C cycle, including particulate and mineral-associated organic C, microbial biomass C, and microbial necromass C. We also examined important processes like soil microbial respiration and enzyme kinetics. Our systematic evaluations helped us distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of warming (i.e., inherent and apparent temperature sensitivity) on SOC formation and loss. Our laboratory incubations showed that warming alone did not produce a sustained increase in microbial respiration or microbial biomass, underscoring the dominant role of C limitation in regulating microbial metabolism. In contrast, adding labile C alone or in combination with nutrients (N + P + C) significantly boosted microbial metabolism, supporting a co-limitation framework in which nutrient amendments became impactful only after alleviating C scarcity. Enzymatic assays further indicated that substrate depletion, rather than enzyme denaturation, constrained any prolonged warming effect. These findings underscore the need for continued research into SOC dynamics and microbial adaptation in nutrient-poor ecosystems, which remain underrepresented in Earth system models."

    "title": "Temporal variability in dissolved organic matter composition export in streams",
    "abstract": "Export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from freshwater systems has been the focus of many studies owing to its pivotal role in regulating global carbon fluxes and ecosystem function. Both the flux and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are critical for understanding its ecological impact, as similar compositions can have vastly different consequences depending on the magnitude of input and hydrological context. However, very little data exists on the composition of DOM export fluxes to downstream ecosystems. Here we investigate the interaction of water temperature and discharge on DOC and DOM composition export fluxes in two streams draining contrasting watersheds (agriculture versus forested) in southern Ontario, Canada across seasons. Using Generalized Additive Models, we observed that both stream discharge and water temperature significantly affected DOM composition, and the proportion of terrestrial humic-like DOM exhibited strong positive relationship with discharge. Although DOC loads were comparable between the two streams, the export loads and fluxes of DOM composition (in terms of fluorescent loads and fluxes) differed significantly. These patterns of DOM composition fluxes in both streams remained consistent across seasons, suggesting that watershed characteristics and nutrient availability primarily govern DOM dynamics and export, while seasonal drivers such as discharge and temperature further modulate these patterns. Export loads and fluxes of DOM components were higher in spring and winter months compared to summer and autumn in both streams, while fluxes also increased at medium (Q10-Q90) and high flow (> Q10) at a variable extent in the contrasting streams. Temperature and discharge regulated export of DOM can be further affected with changing climate and increasing frequency of extreme events and alter the processing and delivery of DOM to downstream ecosystems."

    "title": "Bulk density calculation methods systematically alter estimates of soil organic carbon stocks in United States forests",
    "abstract": "Soils are the largest terrestrial carbon sink on Earth, yet substantial uncertainty in the size and stability of this pool remains. Much of this uncertainty stems from the characterization of bulk density, which is the mass of a soil sample divided by its volume, a key property in the calculation of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. We used data from nearly 2900 plots in the United States (U.S.) Nationwide Forest Inventory to quantify SOC stocks in forests with three common methods of calculating soil bulk density. Mean SOC stocks calculated with these methods varied by up to 13 Mg ha −1 , a difference equivalent to more than 70 percent of the 2022 economy-wide carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. when scaled across all forest area. These differences were primarily driven by inconsistent treatment of coarse materials (i.e. rocks and roots) in soil bulk density calculations, which led to an overestimation of SOC content by 32 percent of the mean SOC stock across all U.S. forests. The largest discrepancies were found in soils with high coarse fragment content, which are more common in ecologically sensitive ecosystems like alpine zones and drylands, and in commercially important softwood forest types. Quantifying the size and stability of SOC in the land sector is essential to understanding how this carbon pool may serve as a nature-based solution to climate change. Consistent and transparent methods are necessary when estimating and reporting SOC content and when comparing SOC dynamics across ecological gradients, with disturbance, and over time."

    "title": "Effects of silicate rock weathering and agricultural cultivation on carbon sequestration in saline soils: an example from the saline soils of Bayannur, Northwest China",
    "abstract": "Carbon sequestration in arid areas is a crucial component of the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. As an alluvial plain in the upper reaches of the yellow river, saline soils in Bayannur have a huge capacity for carbon sequestration. Weathering of coarse-grained silicate minerals (feldspar) from the Langshan Mountain generate CO 3 2− or HCO 3 − , which combine with Ca 2+ transported by the Yellow River, forming inorganic carbon sequestration. Additionally, humic substances produced by agricultural activities, alongside microbial residues, contribute to organic carbon sequestration. This research examines the processes and influencing factors of organic and inorganic carbon sequestration in arid regions by analyzing the soluble salts, minerals, elements, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the topsoil of Bayannur. The results showed that the topsoil (0–10 cm) was highly alkaline, with pH levels ranging from 8.07 to 9.94. The dominant soluble salts in the soil were Na + and SO 4 2− . Soil minerals content in descending order was quartz (Qtz), clay minerals (Clay), plagioclase (Pl), calcite (Cal), K-feldspar (Kfs), and dolomite (Dol). The soil organic carbon (SOC) content ranged from 0.16 to 0.89%, while the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) content ranged from 0.93 to 1.86%. The SOC content in the topsoil of Bayannur (cultivated saline soils) surpasses that in natural saline soils (uncultivated), likely due to increased carbon input from crops and agricultural fertilization. Similarly, the SIC content is also higher than that in natural saline soils. This is attributed to the irrigation process, which increases the concentration of Ca 2+ in the soil and accelerates the weathering of the topsoil."

    "abstract": "Complex interactions controlling carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and inorganic nutrients: calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), in forest soils are difficult to tease apart due to covarying factors (e.g., soil parent material) and reductionist approaches can miss potential synergistic effects. We evaluated if increasing mean annual temperature (MAT), decreased organic horizon development, shallow tree rooting, and accumulation of C, N, and inorganic nutrients. We transplanted 144 mineral soil columns across six temperate forests from Virginia to New Hampshire and collected them 1-year and 4-years later. Our results show that organic horizon C, N, and nutrient pools were negatively associated with MAT with 4 × to 5 × greater pools at the coldest sites than the warmest sites. Since five-years of inputs from litterfall and throughfall monitoring show similar or increasing fluxes with MAT, differences were likely due to faster mineralization and transport from the columns. Transplanted mineral soil C, N, Ca, and P pools did not vary with MAT nor with root-access or root biomass, showing roots and organic horizon masses did not have consistent effects. Mineral soil root and MAT effects may still be developing or impacted by other variables not evaluated. Lastly, we found increases of organic phase Ca, Mg, K, and P from Year 0 to Year 1in the mineral soil across all six sites using Scanning Electron Microscopy- Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–EDS) imaging but only a significant effect of MAT or root-access for K. Our study highlights that MAT, organic horizon development, and nutrient accumulation and storage are linked but not in the mineral soil."

    "abstract": "Selenium (Se) biogeochemistry in boreal and permafrost-rich soils and sediments remains poorly constrained, despite its importance as both an essential micronutrient and potential contaminant. As climate change accelerates warming in northern ecosystems, the mobilization of vast carbon pools may significantly alter Se cycling and bioavailability, with cascading effects on aquatic food webs. In this context, we aim to investigate how temperature and organic matter (OM) lability influence Se redox dynamics in lake sediments, providing insights for predicting its behavior as these northern ecosystems continue to warm. We studied Se sequestration as a function of OM lability, temperature (4 and 23 °C) and Se speciation in minimally disturbed lacustrine sediments using flow-through reactors (FTRs). Initial sediments contained OM characterized as either labile (fresh) or recalcitrant (aged), and were fed with environmentally relevant, low Se concentrations and filtered lake water. We monitored Se concentration as well as speciation along with pH and the concentrations of dissolved OM, NO 3 − , NO 2 − , Fe(II), SO 4 2− and HS − in the outflow of FTRs during 8 experimental phases. All sediments sequestered a large proportion of Se, with FTRs containing fresh OM removing 50% more Se than those containing aged OM. Along with a higher production of reduced species, such as ferrous Fe and sulfides, in the reactors with fresh OM, this result is consistent with reducing conditions promoting Se sequestration. Inflowing selenite was sequestered to a larger extent than inflowing selenate. Lastly, only selenate removal responded strongly to temperature. With an inflow concentration of 100 nM, selenate was sequestered at a rate of 92 pmol cm −3 d −1 at 23 °C, which decreased to 80 pmol cm −3 d −1 at 4 °C. In selenate removal experiments, outflow Se speciation consisted mostly of organic Se species at 23 °C and, in contrast, entirely of selenate at 4 °C. We hypothesize that selenate removal proceeded via microbial processes, consistent with temperature-dependent reactions catalyzed by enzymes. Overall, our findings suggest that the mobilization and warming of the boreal and permafrost carbon pools may increase the capacity of aquatic environments to sequester Se, lowering its bioavailability."

    "abstract": "Polyphosphate is formed by polyphosphate-accumulating organisms occurring in various terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems as well as industrial environments. Although polyphosphate-accumulating organisms and polyphosphate have been well studied in enhanced biological phosphorus (P) removal from wastewater treatment plants, their role in the internal P cycle of natural lakes remains unclear. Several studies have shown that polyphosphate storage is widespread in lake sediments. In this study, 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyse the seasonal dynamics of polyphosphate and its drivers at the sediment surface of three stratified German lakes with strong seasonality of hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. Similar seasonal patterns of polyphosphate were observed in all three lakes. Polyphosphate content increased by a factor of three to five at the beginning of summer stratification, with the maximum content observed in May when oxygen was already very low. During this period, strong redox gradients prevailed within the topmost sediment layer, and highly soluble reactive P concentrations were present in the pore water due to the reductive release of P bound to iron(III)oxides and oxide-hydroxides. Polyphosphate acted as a temporary P storage and was released after a delay, which may mitigate sedimentary P release into the water body during the (early) summer stratification. The observed seasonal dynamics of polyphosphate at the sediment surface offer a novel insight into the link between the P and iron cycles in lakes."

    "abstract": "Geosteering, a key component of drilling operations, traditionally involves manual interpretation of various data sources such as well-log data. This introduces subjective biases and inconsistent procedures. Academic attempts to solve geosteering decision optimization with greedy optimization and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) showed promise but lacked adaptivity to realistic diverse scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to these challenges, facilitating optimal decision-making through reward-based iterative learning. State estimation methods, e.g., particle filter (PF), provide a complementary strategy for geosteering decision-making based on online information. We introduce RL-Estimation, a method that integrates an RL-based geosteering framework with PF to address realistic geosteering scenarios. RL-Estimation deploys PF to process real-time well-log data to estimate the location of the well relative to the stratigraphic layers, which then informs the RL-based decision-making process. Our findings indicate that RL-Estimation achieves at least 20% higher reservoir contact compared to using RL or PF alone. Additionally, RL-Estimation performs within 2% of the theoretically optimal benchmark, which assumes access to the true state instead of relying on estimates from PF. These results demonstrate the synergy between RL and PF, highlighting the method’s effectiveness and near-optimal performance in realistic geosteering scenarios."

    "abstract": "Excess nitrogen (N) in freshwater systems is harmful and can lead to eutrophication, loss of biodiversity and toxic cyanobacterial blooms. External loading of N is an important driver of eutrophication, however, internal processing can either exacerbate or relieve excess N through N 2 fixation or denitrification, respectively. Here, we aimed to determine how variation in N loading and hydrologic setting affect internal N processing in lakes in summer by quantifying N 2 saturation in 17 lakes across a land use gradient in Minnesota and Iowa. We hypothesized that lakes with the highest N loading rates would have the highest N 2 saturation values, indicative of net denitrification. We observed that lakes in agricultural regions had the highest N 2 saturation and all lakes showed the highest levels of supersaturation in June when runoff was maximal. Although seasonal changes affected the degree of N 2 saturation, all lakes were sources of N 2 to the atmosphere throughout the sample period suggesting that denitrification was more impactful to internal processing than was N 2 -fixation. Peaks in N 2 supersaturation co-occurred with both low and high dissolved oxygen levels, the latter being somewhat paradoxical given that denitrification is an anaerobic process."

    "title": "Ocean surface waves impact on global air-sea CO $${}_2$$ flux",
    "abstract": "Ocean surface gravity waves facilitate gas exchanges primarily in two ways: (1) the formation of bubbles during wave breaking increases the surface area available for gas exchange, promoting CO \\(_2\\) transfer, and (2) wave-current interaction processes alter the sea surface partial pressure of CO \\(_2\\) and gas solubility, consequently affecting the CO \\(_2\\) flux. This study tests these influences using a global ocean-ice-biogeochemistry model under preindustrial conditions. The simulation results indicate that both wave–current interaction processes and the sea-state-dependent gas transfer scheme–which explicitly accounts for bubble-mediated gas transfer velocity–influence the air–sea CO \\(_2\\) flux, with substantial spatial and seasonal variations. In the equatorial region (10 \\(^{\\circ }\\) S–10 \\(^{\\circ }\\) N), both processes enhance the CO \\(_2\\) outgassing flux, with comparable magnitudes (more than 10% on average). However, in the region between approximately 10 \\(^{\\circ }\\) and 35 \\(^{\\circ }\\) , the impact of ocean surface waves on the air-sea CO \\(_2\\) flux via the sea-state-dependent gas transfer velocity is greater than that of the wave-current interaction processes, with opposing directions of influence. During winter, the sea-state-dependent gas transfer velocity enhances the CO \\(_2\\) uptake flux, while in the summer season, it increases the CO \\(_2\\) outgassing flux. In regions poleward of 35 \\(^{\\circ }\\) , the impact of wave–current interaction processes on CO \\(_2\\) exchange dominates over that of the sea-state-dependent gas transfer velocity. It is worth noting that the impact of wave-current interaction processes on air-sea CO \\(_2\\) flux is primarily driven by changes in the ratio between the concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity, with variations in sea surface temperature exerting an opposite influence on pCO \\(_2\\) , albeit with a smaller magnitude. Overall, wave-related processes should be considered in Earth System Models to better model the carbon cycle."

    "title": "Adaptive regularization for the Richards equation",
    "abstract": "The Richards equation is ubiquitous in the modelling of flows in porous media. It serves as a model in its own right, but also as a stepping stone to more complex models of multiphase flows. Despite its relative simplicity, it features many challenges from a computational point of view due to the nonsmooth and degenerate nature of the nonlinear state functions. In this paper, we replace these functions with regularized (smooth and nondegenerate) counterparts where the amount of added regularization is controlled by a single regularization parameter. We introduce a set of a simple a posteriori error estimators that we use to adaptively steer the regularization and linearization. In particular, we stop the iterative linearization when the corresponding estimator is dominated by the regularization estimator and adaptively choose the regularization parameter so that the regularization estimator does not dominate the discretization one. The full adaptive algorithm is tested on a suite of numerical examples adapted from recent works on improving the robustness of solvers for the Richards equation and on benchmark cases."

    "title": "Enhancing 3D seismic facies interpretation through a modified patched deep learning approach leveraging spatio-temporal dependencies",
    "abstract": "Seismic facies interpretation plays a vital role in oil and gas exploration and production. However, traditional methods, such as trace inversion and manual interpretation, are often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have emerged as promising and efficient tools for facies identification with 3D seismic data. As a rapidly developing field, deep learning models with various network structures rise up all the time. Some of them are employed by researchers in the case studies of facies interpretation and are claimed as the better methods. However, the influence of the input features especially their inherent data structure, has attracted few discussions so far. Furthermore, most current studies using artificial intelligence for seismic interpretation primarily rely on two major branches of deep learning algorithms: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are skilled in capturing spatial patterns, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are effective at modeling temporal dependencies. As a result, these networks and their variants fail to simultaneously leverage both spatial and temporal coupling of the multidimensional data. In this paper, we replace the matrix multiplications inside the memory cell of the general long short-term memory unit with a convolution operation, which is a basic module of the deep learning framework, to attach the capability of capturing the spatial dependencies with temporal dynamic behavior to the recurrent architecture. A patched deep learning model based on this theoretically rational and programming feasible RNN variant is implemented in three experiments of the 3D seismic facies interpretation. Our study firstly highlights the importance of the input seismic attributes in providing valuable information for making accurate predictions. The results from the first experiment demonstrate that the selection of seismic attributes based on their correlation with the interpretation target greatly enhances the model performance. Furthermore, by comparing the predictions from the proposed model with the ones from the model that just utilizes the spatial dependencies, our study emphasizes the significance of incorporating spatio-temporal dependencies within the chosen seismic attributes during the interpretation, as it leads to improved predictions, especially in boundary detection. Last but not least, our experiments demonstrate that the contribution of spatial dependencies to 3D seismic interpretation diminishes as the spatial distance increases. Therefore, selectively augmenting the training data with samples that have weaker spatial correlations can significantly enhance the model’s performance. Based on our findings, we prefer to conclude that interpreters that consider spatio-temporal dependencies inside the full covering optimized attributes can improve the quality of 3D seismic facies interpretation. This conclusion can serve as an outline for the workflow of Deep Learning-assisted 3D seismic interpretation."

    "title": "Multi-scale channel enhanced transformer for rock thin sections identification and sequence consistency optimization",
    "abstract": "The identification of rock thin sections plays a pivotal role in geological exploration, as it provides critical insights into the fundamental properties and composition of rocks. However, the accurate identification of mineral particles presents significant challenges due to three primary factors: the inherent imbalance in data distribution, misclassification caused by feature similarity, and substantial feature variations observed under different cross-polarized angles. These complexities render conventional deep-learning models with single-structure architectures inadequate for precise mineral particle identification. Therefore, this study proposes a novel rock thin section image classification methodology that combines a Multi-Scale Channel Enhanced Transformer (MSCET) with a Sequence Consistency Optimization (SCO) strategy. This integrated approach is designed to effectively extract distinctive features of mineral particles while fully exploiting the influence of polarization angle variations. The MSCET architecture synergistically combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), and Transformer mechanisms to enhance the network’s feature representation capabilities. Specifically, it employs distinct convolutional operations to extract both coarse- and fine-grained features of mineral particles. The SENet and Transformer structures are then utilized to aggregate global information across both channel and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the SCO strategy to refine low-confidence predictions, thereby mitigating the impact of feature variations in multi-angle cross-polarized images. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, achieving a classification accuracy of 92.35% on the test set. The method also shows significant improvements in key performance metrics, including recall, precision, and F1 score, substantiating its potential for robust rock thin section identification in geological applications."

    "title": "Multi-parameter post-stack seismic inversion based on the cycle loop – semi-supervised learning",
    "abstract": "Seismic inversion is used to evaluate hydrocarbon reservoirs by inferring subsurface physical properties from seismic data. The most prevalent seismic inversion method is post-stack seismic inversion, as most seismic data is available in post-stack format. However, this method only transforms impedance parameters from seismic data. Therefore, to extract additional parameters such as density and P wave velocity/Vp from post-stack seismic data, we developed Cycle Loop – Semi-Supervised Learning for multi-parameter post-stack seismic inversion (Cycle-MPInv). This method combines a deep learning-based inversion network and forward modeling to perform seismic inversion and forward modeling simultaneously (semi-supervised learning). The forward model provides geophysical constraint, while deep learning employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) to extract both high- and low-frequency features. In Cycle-MPInv, we also process labeled parameter data and calculate the loss to enhance the learning process and improve accuracy, so there are two loops that we call the cycle loop process. The proposed method was tested on synthetic data (Marmoussi II model) and data from the Netherlands offshore F3 block. Results from both datasets demonstrate that Cycle-MPInv effectively leverages both low- and high-frequency features of multi-parameter properties (density, Vp, and impedance) with limited labeled data. Furthermore, Cycle-MPInv achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to other deep learning methods, even when handling noisy seismic data. These findings suggest that this method can offer valuable additional parameter insights for hydrocarbon reservoir evaluation using post-stack seismic data."

    "title": "Numerical stabilization of coupled wellbore-reservoir multiphase hydrodynamic solution by a contracting operator",
    "abstract": "In this study, we address the challenge of stabilizing a numerical model for a coupled wellbore–reservoir multiphase hydrodynamic system, with a focus on optimizing wellbore cleanup operations in the oil and gas industry. This goal requires executing multiple forward simulations within optimization routines, elevating the importance of model stability and computational efficiency. The model used in this work is unique in its ability to directly simulate the cleanup of a near-wellbore zone of the hydrocarbon-filled porous reservoir formation damaged by the drilling mud invasion during drilling. Rather than relying on the conventional practice of reducing the relaxation factor to ensure a contractive coupling operator, we propose techniques that target intrinsic features of the solution to enhance stability. First, we implement adaptive time-stepping to improve robustness in temporal evolution. Second, we introduce a novel reservoir splitting approach for one-dimensional reservoir models, where flow rate is computed as the product of the flow rate per unit length and thickness. We transition to a multilayer reservoir structure, aligning each wellbore numerical cell with a distinct reservoir layer. A detailed description of this method is provided, along with simulation results demonstrating its impact on fidelity and stability. Third, we apply a phase correction mechanism to eliminate unphysical negative volume fractions arising before convergence. Finally, we enhance convergence using the Aitken relaxation method. These techniques collectively reduce the Lipschitz constant of the coupling operator, enabling both improved stability and faster convergence. We show that this reduction also offsets the computational overhead introduced, achieving an effective balance between robustness and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Optimizing well placement is one of the primary challenges in oil field development. The number and positions of wells must be carefully considered, as it is directly related to the infrastructure cost and the profits over the field’s life cycle. In this paper, we propose three estimation of distribution algorithms to optimize well placement with the objective of maximizing the net present value. The methods are guided by an elite set of solutions and are able to obtain multiple local optima in a single run. We also present an auxiliary regression model to preemptively discard candidate solutions with poor performance prediction, thus avoiding running computationally expensive simulations for unpromising candidates. The model is trained with the data obtained during the search process and does not require previous training. Our algorithms yielded a significant improvement compared to a state-of-the-art reference method from the literature, as evidenced by computational experiments with two benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Traditional seismic inversion is expensive and relies heavily on unstable stochastic methods. Deep learning (DL) is a cost-effective method that excels in extracting intricate features from data and making precise predictions. However, while challenges such as the lack of interpretability, scarcity of borehole label data, and insufficiency of synthetic data to generate scenarios consistent with actual geology persist, this study demonstrates how we can improve the robustness and applicability of inversion solutions. We propose a hybrid method that leverages physical constraints provided by a rock-physics equation while harnessing the efficiency of DL to effectively approximate inversion solutions. We used a porosity model along an interpreted seismic horizon based on well logs to simulate the reservoir’s bulk and shear moduli with different saturating fluids. This model provided a priori knowledge of the modelling process to strengthen stability and consistency with local geologic conditions. We used the obtained moduli in empirical equations to compute the saturated reservoir seismic wave velocities. This provided the necessary labels for training four baseline networks with different topologies and hyperparameters to invert seismic amplitude data into Vp/Vs, Poisson’s ratio, and acoustic impedance. Subsequently, we weighted individual baseline model predictions based on their accuracies and aggregated them to achieve robust models. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance compared with conventional inversion and popular DL approaches in a real-world application. The study results are critical for fluid discrimination and understanding the reservoir’s potential for oil and gas production."

    "title": "Lightweight permeability prediction of digital rocks by merging 3D depthwise separable convolution with efficient multiscale attention",
    "abstract": "Permeability is a crucial parameter in geology and petroleum engineering. Traditional methods for measuring the permeability of rocks primarily rely on physical experiments, which can easily damage the integrity of rocks, thus affecting subsequent analyses. Current approaches are mainly based on digital rock images using direct numerical simulation methods or deep learning methods to obtain permeability. Although these methods avoid destroying rocks, there are challenges of high computational complexity and capturing complex features on the microstructure for different rocks. To address these challenges, we design a novel network for the lightweight and efficient prediction of permeability in 3D porous media. We made our novel design in two steps: First, to reduce the computational burden, we introduced three-dimensional depthwise separable convolution into the network. Second, to enhance the capture of micro-features in digital rock, we incorporate an efficient multi-scale attention mechanism into the network. Finally, we propose the 3D-EmaSepNet. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D-EmaSepNet performs well on different rock types, such as sandstones and carbonates. Specifically, compared to traditional three-dimensional convolution, the computational cost of 3D-EmaSepNet using three-dimensional depthwise separable convolution is reduced by a factor of 9.6. Our 3D-EmaSepNet achieves coefficient of determination (R 2 score) of 94.57% and mean squared error (MSE) loss of 0.10 on the validation dataset for sandstone, while reaching R 2 score of 93.91% and MSE loss of 0.31 on the validation dataset for carbonate. These results show the potential of 3D-EmaSepNet for practical applications in geology, petroleum engineering, and other fields."

    "abstract": "The flow velocity in metre-scale natural fracture networks readily exceeds centimetres per second, the threshold for non-stationary flow. However, despite widespread evidence of such dynamics, these are rarely considered in subsurface engineering applications, where steady-state simulation approaches dominate. Here, we compare Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) methods for the transient Navier-Stokes equation applied to fracture flow. These models are validated with experimental data of flow through fracture intersections. DES is then applied to a metre-scale fracture pattern with hundreds of discrete fractures, examining flow dynamics at velocities up to metres per second (m/s). DES accurately captures the temporal flow fluctuation and multiscale eddy formation, especially when a fine computational mesh is used in wake regions. By contrast, unsteady RANS fails to capture flow-field variations and produces results similar to steady RANS. DES reveals significant network flow periodicity ( \\(\\sim \\) 40 Hz) at m/s velocities, unlike the low-frequency results ( \\(\\sim \\) 0.4 Hz) from RANS. We also explore the impact of unsteady flow on particle transport by integrating mixture-multiphase and rheological models into DES. Corresponding results indicate that inertia alters the concentration of transported solids, mixture viscosity, and particle dynamics such as clustering."

    "title": "Two-phase analysis of oedometric gas injection tests with simplified representation of geomechanical effects",
    "abstract": "In the context of numerical modeling for the assessment of a radioactive waste repository in a tight clay formation, the question arises whether a standard two-phase flow formulation is sufficient to capture the dissipation of gas generated by the degradation of engineered barrier components, or whether more sophisticated constitutive relations, including those accounting for geomechanical effects in deformable materials, need to be incorporated. The appropriateness of using effective geomechanical and two-phase flow parameters in a performance assessment model is examined by inverse modeling, which is used to interpret the experimental data from oedometric gas injection experiments on core samples. Effective parameters are estimated using both a conventional two-phase flow formulation as well as alternative constitutive models that account for the volumetric deformation of the specimen. The conventional model is capable of reproducing the pressure and gas flow data observed in the experiment. However, axial strain data reflecting the expansion and compression of the specimen in response to gas injection are not reproducible by the simple pore deformation model. Joint inversions of all available flow and deformation data performed with different effective stress models lead to similar matches. This indicates that (a) the differences between the conceptual models are either minor, (b) they can be compensated by estimating effective model parameters, or (c) that the calibration data do not contain sufficient information to discriminate amongst the alternative models. Nevertheless, the use of a two-phase flow model with a refined pore deformation relationship appears appropriate for performance assessment calculations."

    "title": "Efficient multi-scale image reconstruction of heterogeneous rocks with unresolved porosity using octree structures",
    "abstract": "Identifying rock properties at the pore scale plays a crucial role in understanding larger-scale properties. For this purpose, the digital rock physics technique is used to model rock images at the pore scale. Achieving high-resolution (HR) images with a large field of view (FoV) is essential for pore-scale modeling of heterogeneous rock samples, which presents significant challenges due to their complex structures. However, because of the trade-off between resolution and FoV, it is not possible to acquire large HR images. Multi-scale image reconstruction methods enable modeling images at different resolutions and FoVs. Despite various approaches being introduced, a common limitation is the high computational cost. In this study, a novel approach based on Octree structures is introduced to minimize computational cost while maintaining accuracy. A Berea sandstone (BS) and an Edward Brown Carbonate (EBC) sample were scanned at both HR and low resolution (LR) using X-ray microtomography. Our method involves splitting the unresolved porosity in rock images into smaller sections of unresolved templates using the watershed algorithm and considering the optimized parameters. We then applied a cross-correlation based simulation technique to find the best match of each unresolved template. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of an Octree structure to perform calculations on LR images, significantly reducing computation time and memory consumption due to the fewer number of pixels in Octree LR structures. The accuracy of the images thus reconstructed using our approach was compared with those from previous methods by evaluating geometric properties and single- and two-phase flow properties. The results were promising, demonstrating that our approach achieved a permeability close to the real value, while the previous method had an error of approximately 4% for both BS and EBC rocks. More importantly, our approach was approximately three times faster and reduced memory usage by 20 to 130 times. The findings of this study facilitate dual- or multi-scale modeling and evaluate heterogeneous rock images at a significantly lower computational cost. In particular, for heterogeneous rocks, where multi-scale image reconstruction demands substantial memory and runtime, the use of the Octree technique enables accurate reconstruction with lower computational cost."

    "title": "Wind-powered reservoir management with application to robust multi-objective optimization",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating offshore wind power into reservoir management. Traditionally, oil and gas production is powered by gas turbines. While stable, gas turbines are a major source of CO2 emissions. In contrast, wind power produces power with minimal emissions. However, due to its high variability and uncertainty, including it in the optimization of operational strategies over extended periods can be challenging. In this paper, the optimization of production strategies over an ensemble of realistic wind power series is investigated. The ensemble is generated by a mathematical model consisting of an autoregressive model with a seasonal trend. The model is conditioned on relevant wind speed data from the North Sea with Bayesian inference. The wind speed data is selected from the open-access NORA10EI dataset. The methodology developed in this paper is applied to a multi-objective optimization problem, focusing on studying the tradeoff between profit and emissions. A benchmark test reservoir model and a detailed CO2 emissions calculator are employed. In this scenario, wind power is combined with traditional gas power, and all results are compared with a reference where only gas power is used. The experiment indicates that it is not possible to reduce emissions by 40% without the use of wind power."

    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is widely employed in the exploitation of underground resources, and the variation in natural fracture width plays an important role in the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing. In this work, a Hydro-Mechanical Coupling Model (HM) was primarily established to explore the influence of fracture width, fluid viscosities, and fracture angle on natural fracture transformation based on the Peridynamics (PD) method. Then, the accuracy of the PD model was validated by comparing the numerical simulation results with analytical solutions. Ultimately, a series of numerical models were established to numerically investigate the influence of fracture widths, fluid viscosity, and fracture angles on the development of natural fracture. Results show that a larger initial natural fracture width or a decrease in fluid viscosity can increase the pore water pressure in the natural fracture, which in turn leads to a better natural fracture modification. The initial width of the natural fracture and the fluid viscosity directly influence the rate of variation in natural fracture width. The angle of natural fracture has a relatively small impact on the pore water pressure in fractures, while a greater impact on the displacement field surrounding the fracture."

    "title": "Implicit time discretisation as a potential avenue to achieve full coupling between shallow water flow and bedload transport",
    "abstract": "In general, modelling bedload transport requires a full coupling between shallow water equations and sediment balance equations. Nevertheless, splitting approaches can be applied, depending on the time step size and the degree of interaction between flow and mobile bed. This work employs an implicit time discretisation to implement both a fully coupled and a splitting approach. The currently available approaches utilise an appropriate calculation of the numerical flux at the cell faces, e.g. Roe’s scheme, in order to ensure a full coupling. However, this work demonstrates that a fully coupled approach can also be achieved through an implicit time discretisation, as it combines the shallow water and the sediment balance equations into a system of non-linear equations, thereby ensuring full coupling between shallow water flow and bedload transport. The full coupling via implicit time discretisation has the advantage of being applicable to arbitrary bedload transport problems. In contrast, the existing fully coupled approaches are only applicable to uniform bedload transport and are not suitable for mixed size bedload transport with several grain classes or in situations where modifications to the bedload discharge rate are required, such as secondary currents or gravitational transport. Unlike the fully coupled approach, the splitting approach solves the shallow water equations and the sediment balance equations sequentially, resulting in two non-linear systems per time step. This work compares the two presented coupling approaches in terms of computational cost and with regard to the applicability of the splitting approach. The comparison indicates that, where applicable, the splitting approach often offers a superior performance compared to the presented fully coupled approach, particularly in cases involving several grain classes."

    "abstract": "Reservoir simulation typically considers the aqueous phase as inert, i.e., water is not in thermodynamic equilibrium with other components; specific applications nevertheless require accounting for mass exchange between aqueous and hydrocarbon phases. Søreide and Whitson Equation of State (EoS) was recently implemented in a mass variables-based reservoir simulator and applied to models where only vapor and aqueous phases are present at reservoir conditions (Panfili et al. Computational geosciences , pp 1–14, 2023). We here describe the extension of said implementation to support component partitioning across the three reservoir phases. With the mass variables formulation, phase equilibrium calculations are needed in each cell at each Newton’s iteration. The equilibration algorithm adopted in this work consists in starting with a negative flash and an initial guess containing three phases. This approach is computationally heavier than one where additional phases are progressively introduced as needed based on stability testing, but is simpler to implement while representing an acceptable fraction of the overall simulation time in practical cases. Realistic application cases where hydrocarbon-water mass exchange plays an important role in the physics of the recovery/storage process, such as estimation of the impact of water vaporization on the final recovery in high-pressure/high-temperature gas condensate fields, CO \\(_2\\) -based enhanced oil recovery and modeling of CO \\(_2\\) sequestration in depleted gas condensate fields, have been simulated.

    "abstract": "Efficient downscaling of large ensembles of coarse-scale information is crucial in several applications, such as oceanic and atmospheric modeling. The determining form map is a theoretical lifting function from the low-resolution solution trajectories of a dissipative dynamical system to their corresponding high-resolution counterparts. Recently, a physics-informed deep neural network (“CDAnet”) was introduced, providing a surrogate of the determining form map for efficient downscaling. CDAnet was demonstrated to efficiently downscale noise-free coarse-scale data in a deterministic setting. Herein, the performance of well-trained CDAnet models is analyzed in a stochastic setting involving (i) observational noise, (ii) model noise, and (iii) a combination of observational and model noise. The analysis is performed employing the Rayleigh-Bénard convection paradigm, under three training conditions, namely, training with perfect, noisy, or downscaled data. Furthermore, the effects of noise, Rayleigh number, and spatial and temporal resolutions of the input coarse-scale information on the downscaled fields are examined. The results suggest that the expected \\(\\ell _2\\) -error of CDAnet behaves quadratically in terms of the standard deviations of the observational and model noise. The results also suggest that CDAnet responds to uncertainties similar to the theorized and numerically-validated CDA behavior with an additional error overhead due to CDAnet being a surrogate of the determining form map."

    "abstract": "Performance assessment and field-development planning for carbon geo-sequestration relies on reservoir simulation. The standard approach is to use regular (corner-point) grids in space and a fully implicit discretisation in time, solving for all primary unknowns at once using Newton’s method. While the former limits the physical realism of the simulation model built from the geomodel, the latter leads to a large ill-conditioned system of equations that is inefficient to solve. We overcome the regularisation issue via a hierarchy of fully unstructured, geobody-conforming, finite element meshes which can be refined until mesh convergence is achieved. To address the time discretisation issue we employ, for the first time, the linearly implicit extrapolation scheme (LIMEX) to solve the highly non-linear coupled two-phase flow and reactive transport equations. To solve the arising large sparse systems of linear equations, we apply the geometric multigrid (GMG) method that demonstrates optimal, linear complexity and allows an efficient parallelization on supercomputers. Another novel feature of our formulation is the consideration of the kinetics of mass transfer between the carbonic and aqueous phases. This approach removes the first-order dependence on mesh refinement of \\(C\\!O_2\\) that is dissolved, a characteristic feature of standard equilibrium models. We demonstrate the parallel scalability of our simulation framework with an implementation based on the UG4 platform. Proof-of-concept results accurately capture key features of \\(C\\!O_2\\) migration including filtration by capillary barriers and convective dissolution of \\(C\\!O_2\\) at the base of the plume."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction tools for land subsidence induced by oil/gas production are fundamental for energy companies to identify possible affected areas and to propose measures to counteract its potentially adverse effects. The flow-deformation models are computationally demanding so their use in a data assimilation workflow is unfeasible for large models. The calibration process requires running the simulation for several values of the parameters of the PDE to find the sets that best reproduce the observed data. Parameters are petrophysical but also mechanical properties of the rocks. Observed data are production data (well flow rates and pressures) and geodetic measurements, like data from global positioning system (GPS). We propose an approach for fluid and subsidence estimation based on functional kriging surrogate models to jointly replicate the temporal behavior of fluid production and subsidence with a very low computational cost. Then, using Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) it is possible to automatically assimilate multiple data sources rapidly and to predict the forecast uncertainty. The workflow has been applied on two test cases: a synthetic reservoir which is a benchmark in the reservoir modeling community and a real field. In both cases, surrogate models proved to be computationally efficient and data assimilation led to an ensemble of models able to quantify prediction uncertainties accurately."

In this work, we treat 3D synthetic reservoir images with channelized facies adopting a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE), which is then coupled with an Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ESMDA) workflow. The goal is to parameterize the ensemble of reservoir models into a latent space and to calibrate it. An extensive hyperparamters tuning is conducted: the identification of optimal parameters allows to find a compromise between the reconstruction accuracy and the generative ability of the network. Thanks to this study, the results of the history match are significantly improved. A sensitivity analysis to assess the possibility of reducing the training set size without deteriorating the ESMDA accuracy is also carried out."

    "abstract": "The ensemble Gaussian mixture filter (EnGMF) is a non-linear filter suited to data assimilation of highly non-Gaussian and non-linear models that has practical utility in the case of a small number of samples, and theoretical convergence to full Bayesian inference in the ensemble limit. We aim to increase the utility of the EnGMF by introducing an ensemble-local notion of covariance into the kernel density estimation (KDE) step for the prior distribution, regularizing the local covariances by the ensemble that generated it. We prove that in the Gaussian case, our new ensemble-regularized KDE technique is exactly the same as more traditional KDE techniques. We also show an example of a non-Gaussian distribution that can fail to be approximated by canonical KDE methods, but can be approximated well by our new KDE technique. We showcase our new KDE technique on two simple bivariate problem, showing that it has nice qualitative and quantitative properties, and improves the estimate of the prior and posterior distributions across a broad range of possibilities. We additionally show the utility of the proposed methodology for sequential filtering for the Lorenz ’63 equations, achieving a significant reduction in error, and less conservative behavior in the uncertainty estimate with respect to traditional techniques. Additional experiments on the Lorenz ’96 equations show that EnGMF type filters can converge for low amounts of samples, though without significant improvement for the approach presented in this work."

    "abstract": "The properties of a block preconditioner that has been successfully used in finite element simulations of large scale ice-sheet flow is examined. The type of preconditioner, based on approximating the Schur complement with the mass matrix scaled by the variable viscosity, is well-known in the context of Stokes flow and has previously been analyzed for other types of non-Newtonian fluids. We adapt the theory to hold for the regularized constitutive (power-law) equation for ice and derive eigenvalue bounds of the preconditioned system for both Picard and Newton linearization using inf-sup stable finite elements. The eigenvalue bounds show that viscosity-scaled preconditioning clusters the eigenvalues well with only a weak dependence on the regularization parameter, while the eigenvalue bounds for the traditional non-viscosity-scaled mass-matrix preconditioner are very sensitive to the same regularization parameter. The results are verified numerically in two experiments using a manufactured solution with low regularity and a simulation of glacier flow. The numerical results further show that the computed eigenvalue bounds for the viscosity-scaled preconditioner are nearly independent of the regularization parameter. Experiments are performed using both Taylor-Hood and MINI elements, which are the common choices for inf-sup stable elements in ice-sheet models. Both elements conform well to the theoretical eigenvalue bounds, with MINI elements being more sensitive to the quality of the meshes used in glacier simulations."

    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is one of the primary greenhouse gases and has a significant impact on global climate change. Based on multi-source satellite and meteorological data, this study develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-ensemble learning hybrid model for the rapid retrieval of column-averaged atmospheric CO 2 concentrations observed by the GOSAT satellite. The results show that the CNN-LSTM-Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBOOST) achieves the best performance in global predictions, with a coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0.93), root mean square error (RMSE = 0.81 ppm), and mean absolute error (MAE = 0.64 ppm), significantly outperforming the CNN-LSTM-Random Forest (RF) model. On a seasonal scale, CNN-LSTM-XGBOOST achieves the highest prediction accuracy in summer and autumn (R 2 reaching 0.94 and 0.92, respectively). Latitude analysis shows that low-latitude regions (0°–30°N/S) exhibit the smallest prediction errors (RMSE = 0.52–0.57 ppm). Seasonal and latitudinal findings further indicate that although the short-term emission fluctuations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 did not alter the dominant seasonal carbon cycle mechanisms, they highlighted the dynamic impact of human activities on regional CO 2 concentrations. The findings of this study provide a novel approach and valuable insights for the rapid retrieval and prediction of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, contributing to the advancement of climate research and environmental monitoring."

    "title": "Preserving nonlinear constraints in variational flow filtering data assimilation",
    "abstract": "Data assimilation aims to estimate the states of a dynamical system by optimally combining sparse and noisy observations of the physical system with uncertain forecasts produced by a computational model. The states of many dynamical systems of interest obey nonlinear physical constraints, and the corresponding dynamics is confined to a certain sub-manifold of the state space. Standard data assimilation techniques applied to such systems yield posterior states lying outside the manifold, violating the physical constraints. This work focuses on particle flow filters which use stochastic differential equations to evolve state samples from a prior distribution to samples from an observation-informed posterior distribution. The variational Fokker-Planck (VFP)—a generic particle flow filtering framework—is extended to incorporate non-linear, equality state constraints in the analysis. To this end, two algorithmic approaches that modify the VFP stochastic differential equation are discussed: (i) VFPSTAB, to inexactly preserve constraints with the addition of a stabilizing drift term, and (ii) VFPDAE, to exactly preserve constraints by treating the VFP dynamics as a stochastic differential-algebraic equation (SDAE). Additionally, an implicit-explicit time integrator is developed to evolve the VFPDAE dynamics. The strength of the proposed approach for constraint preservation in data assimilation is demonstrated on three test problems: the double pendulum, Korteweg-de-Vries, and the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations."

    "title": "A distributed field-scale parallel nonlinear domain-decomposition solver",
    "abstract": "Standard solution strategies in reservoir simulators all rely on a global linearization and the solution of large (ill-conditioned) linear systems, particularly for fully implicit formulations. Such solves are expensive, and typically require significant interprocess communication when implemented on a distributed memory architecture. Modern nonlinear domain decomposition (NLDD) is based on adaptive alternation between local and global solves and has proved to be an effective way to reduce the number of global linear solves in serial mode. Herein, we discuss the extension of NLDD to a distributed setting, exemplified by the operational reservoir simulator OPM Flow. We discuss which parts are reused from the standard Newton solver and which modifications are required to deploy the methodology in a standard simulator. We apply our new methods to a series of open benchmark and real-life asset models. In serial, NLDD benefits significantly from using a Gauss–Seidel approach in which subdomains are solved in order of decreasing pressure. This strategy can only be applied effectively within each process in a distributed setting, but not between processes, which potentially poses a challenge to scalability. However, we observe excellent improvement in efficiency of the nonlinear solution phase also in parallel, in particular when slight adjustments are made in the choice of linear solver. Our implementations are freely available as open source, enabling readers to reproduce many of the examples on their own hardware and test the methods on their own models."

    "abstract": "We present two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of the natural convection flow within an artificial underground cavity. We consider a realistic geometry reconstructed from measurements (3D point cloud obtained with a photogrammetric method) of the Barcq cavity existing in Normandy region, France. The numerical model solves the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the unsteady heat equation using a finite-element method for the space discretization. Time integration is based on a semi-implicit method and the Newton method to solve the resulting non-linear equation. To implement the method, we use the free software FreeFem++ offering efficient mesh refinement/adaptivity tools. The parallelization of the simulations relies upon the PETSc software library, to which FreeFem++ offers an easy-to-use interface. We analyze the onset of the natural convection and characterize the convective cells developing within the Barcq cavity for four Rayleigh (Ra) numbers (from \\(\\varvec{10}^{\\varvec{5}}\\) to \\(\\varvec{10}^{\\varvec{8}}\\) ). Dimensionless temperatures, velocities and Nusselt numbers are presented for each Ra number. We discuss how these results can be used to understand the thermal behavior of small artificial cavities. We address in particular the influence of the value of the Rayleigh number on the flow inside the well, which is essential for designing detection methods based on surface temperature observations. The FreeFem++ numerical code used for this study is distributed as supplemental material."

    "title": "Multiple data assimilation as an approximate maximum a posteriori estimator",
    "abstract": "Data assimilation is the process of integrating observational data into a time series of state estimates. For linear-Gaussian systems, an optimal state estimate always exists. This optimal solution both minimizes mean-square error and maximizes the Bayesian posterior distribution at every time step. If the observation model is nonlinear, then the posterior distribution is no longer Gaussian; the minimum mean-square error state estimate and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) state estimate may not coincide. Still, the MAP estimate may be sought using optimization or other means. Multiple Data Assimilation (MDA) is a recursive approach that has been found empirically to produce similar state estimates to optimization-based approaches. However, convergence has been difficult to prove analytically. In this work, we shed new light on MDA by deriving it from a homotopy function. From this viewpoint, MDA is not an optimization but an approximate numerical solution to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Given this new ODE formulation, we propose a new adaptive-step MDA algorithm inspired by the Runge Kutta integration method. The new algorithm outperforms standard approaches on a chaotic system with highly nonlinear measurements. We conclude that MDA is not an exact MAP estimator, but it can still provide a good approximation of the MAP given reasonable local linearity of the observation model."

We demonstrate the method on realistic case studies, including the Johansen and Sleipner sites, showing that MLMC with VE can significantly reduce simulation time compared to standard Monte Carlo methods. This makes large-scale ensemble simulations feasible for applications such as storage capacity estimation and improved uncertainty estimates to be used in value-of-information (VOI) monitoring design."

    "title": "A discrete fracture matrix framework for simulating single-phase flow and non-isothermal reactive transport",
    "abstract": "Simulating reactive transport in fractured porous media is computationally demanding since it requires solving physical and chemical processes that non-linearly affect each other. At the same time, the processes strongly depend on the presence of fractures. Fractures typically behave as shortcuts for flow and transport, while chemical reactions can trigger mineral dissolution or precipitation that might alter the fracture conductivity, thereby modifying the flow regime. The computational demands increase with the number of chemical species, subject to chemical equilibrium and kinetics, and with the complexity of fracture networks. In the case of reservoir simulations, where there are a considerable number of chemical species and fracture networks are highly complex, the computational requirements are severe. In this paper, we present a simulation strategy that handles reactive transport processes with numerous chemical reactions and their two-way interaction with fractures. The governing processes are modelled by conservation equations, joint with ordinary differential equations and non-linear algebraic equations. The fractures are explicitly represented and treated as lower-dimensional objects. We propose a sequential fully implicit procedure to solve the model equations, where the flow and transport equations are solved in a global sense using the open-source code PorePy and the chemical equations are solved using the open-source code Reaktoro. The implementation is established by comparing our simulation results to those from a previously presented study. Moreover, we also show that the presented simulation strategy can handle the coupled processes in porous media with numerous chemical species and intersecting fractures."

The DFNMesh algorithm is adopted to generate the Finite Element meshes and a novel methodology to handle overlapping fractures in the context of Mixed Finite Element methods is explored. Flux approximation with H(div)-conforming spaces are adopted which are particularly appealing for this analysis because of its inherent properties such as local mass conservation and strong divergence-free enforcement for incompressible flows. The analyses are carried out using simple two-fracture domains and a benchmark problem with eight fractures."

    "abstract": "Surface microseismic is a technique aimed at characterizing hydraulic fracturing or reservoir behavior by assessing mechanisms and locating micro-earthquakes related to the operations. Typically, a large number of receivers are used for observations, and migration operators are employed for surface microseismic data processing, which can be time-consuming. Inversion for source mechanism further adds to the computational burden as it involves scanning the space of source mechanism parameters through numerous summations. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach to microseismic data processing. Firstly, we apply a migration operator corresponding to the isotropic mechanism. Next, we utilize a neural network to process the migrated image and estimate the microseismic event location as well as the source mechanism. Our suggestion is to train the neural network using data transformations obtained through migration-based summation, resulting in images that capture specific patterns influenced by the location and source mechanism. To generate the training dataset, we compute surface gathers from sources with various locations and mechanisms, introduce Gaussian noise to distort them, and produce corresponding images. We evaluate the neural network using synthetic data distorted by real recorded noise and demonstrate its effectiveness in locating microseismic events and determining their mechanisms. Additionally, we analyze the limitations of this approach, including its sensitivity to noise and insensitivity to certain mechanisms’ orientations, such as ideal normal faults."

    "title": "JutulDarcy.jl - a fully differentiable high-performance reservoir simulator based on automatic differentiation",
    "abstract": "Reservoir simulators are highly complex computer programs and are often treated as “black boxes” that act on standardized input formats. In part, this is due to the closed-source nature of commercial offerings commonly used in industry, but even when the source-code is available, modification of a fully featured simulator can be a daunting task: A reservoir simulation problem, when fully specified, can have a great number of parameters and functional relationships that are tightly coupled together in most implementations. This is an obstacle to workflows that go beyond forecasting and into optimization, parameter fitting and sensitivity analysis where the solution quantity of interest should be paired with gradients taken with respect to forces and parameters. The monolithic design of typical reservoir simulation codes cannot be separated from the technical and mathematical choices made when discretizing the governing equations: The implicitness required to handle pressure changes and strong coupling between different solution variables means that the Jacobian of the governing equations must be implemented with respect to the primary variables: An error-prone process when done manually, and highly time-consuming when considering coupled systems. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a common cure to this problem that can generate Jacobians, but often comes at a severe cost in runtime performance. A more practical issue is that high computational performance for simulation problems relevant to modern geoenergy operations necessitates implementation in a compiled language while optimization and history matching workflows that integrate many data sources are most naturally expressed in high-level scripting languages. We describe the design of JutulDarcy, an open-source porous media simulator written in the Julia language. JutulDarcy is designed from the ground up with extensibility and computation of sensitivities in mind, starting from the assumption that high-performance automatic differentiation enables us to radically rethink the way simulators are designed. Highlights of this design include arbitrary execution graphs for the equation terms, in which dependence relationships can be re-configured on the fly, easy coupling of models, computation of sensitivities with respect to all model parameters through an adjoint method with a parameter declaration system, and an assembly process with performance that can exceed that of compiled simulators with hand-coded Jacobians. We validate the simulator on a number of standard test cases (immiscible, black-oil, CO2 and compositional flow) and demonstrate MPI parallel performance on multi-million cell models. In addition, we offer a frank assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Julia programming language for scientific computing."

    "abstract": "The scope of the work is to develop high-speed and fairly accurate methods for calculating (i) the productivity of wells with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and (ii) the fluids flow near fractures to fast perform multivariate calculations for inversion framework or optimization problems. For this purpose we propose a method of decomposing the spatial problem of fluid inflow to fractures into two-dimensional problems in the fractures and one-dimensional problems in the reservoir through stream tubes. The structure of the stream tubes is assumed to be fixed and can be determined by a simplified analytical method or from a preliminary numerical solution of a steady state spatial problem. In the simplified method a combination of two typical drainage elements near fractures is considered with the stream-tube parameterization based on exact analytical solutions. This method has satisfactory accuracy and can be used to quickly calculating well productivity in the case of infinite conductivity fractures. Its advantage over known analytical models is demonstrated. Estimates for the applicability of this approach to the finite permeability fractures are also obtained. Computing two-component and two-phase flows, we demonstrate the possibility of increasing the speed of high-precision numerical simulation up to two orders of magnitude due to reducing the dimension of the non-steady transport problem. Parallel algorithms of solving transport problems in independent stream tubes additionally speeds up calculations. The achieved reduction in computer time makes it possible, in principle, to solve inverse problems on high-resolution grids, such as the design of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing or the identification of fracture parameters based on the results of tracer studies."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid advance in computing and deep learning technologies, more and more modern designs of neural network models are introduced. Numerous research has been conducted to explore the potential of these models on solving subsurface problems. Instead of investigating the performance of these developed models on subsurface applications, this paper aims to introduce a new concept that helps deep learning models identify the location of a source in a subsurface flow field. In this study, the concept of conservation field is introduced that is initially calculated by a simplified scheme for homogeneous domains and then the scheme is generalized using trained U-Net models based on a Gaussian kernel. Even with the simplified scheme, the source localization accuracy using conservation data is increased by more than 4 times compared to using pressure data directly. When using the Gaussian kernel-based approach with the presented postprocessing technique, the accuracy is further enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude. Even for datasets with different degrees of heterogeneity and uncertain number of source, the model trained with the homogeneous dataset of single-source still maintains a high accuracy. Furthermore, the presented probability learning approach can produce a series of possible source locations tied with probabilities, instead of only making single prediction. Analysis criteria are introduced to determine real source locations from all possible locations."

However, in most cases the dimensionally reduced model lacks the accuracy to capture the dynamics of a system. While conventional full-dimensional models have the ability to represent dynamics, they come at the cost of high computational effort. We aim to combine the efficiency of the vertical equilibrium model and the accuracy of the full-dimensional model by coupling the two models adaptively in a unified framework and solving the emerging system of equations in a monolithic, fully-implicit approach. The model domains are coupled via mass-conserving fluxes while the model adaptivity is ruled by adaptive criteria. Overall, the adaptive model shows an excellent behaviour both in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency, especially for elongated geometries of storage systems with large aspect ratios."

    "abstract": "Water flow routing algorithms are a cornerstone of landscape evolution models (LEMs), enabling efficient simulations of complex water flow networks across varying spatial and temporal scales. Among these, multiple flow direction (MFD) and single flow direction (SFD) algorithms are widely used to compute local drainage areas, yet they suffer from mesh dependency issues that compromise their consistency. This long-standing problem has motivated various empirical corrections. Despite these efforts, the lack of a robust mathematical framework has hindered a complete resolution of these deficiencies. Building on recent findings based on general Gauckler-Manning-Strickler (GMS) water mass conservation models, this paper unifies existing MFD/SFD methodologies, including node-to-node variants. We demonstrate that all such algorithms can be corrected through a simple post-processing step, effectively eliminating anomalous grid dependency while preserving the diversity of approaches in the literature. The proposed framework bridges the gap between traditional MFD algorithms and more modern definition of the specific catchment area. It also enables a classification of classical MFD/SFD algorithms based on their flow-sharing formulas. Numerical examples illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of this correction."

The corresponding edge-based finite element solution, for both hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes, is derived in detail, and the attenuation characteristics of the EPMLs are compared to their standard uniaxial counterparts. In doing so, we demonstrate the superiority of EPMLs in eliminating the non-physical reflection at the boundaries of the computational domain. Further, we demonstrate that the use of EPML absorbing boundaries effectively improves the efficiency of 3D ground-penetrating frequency-domain simulations, as they require significantly fewer layers and are less parameter-dependent than conventional uniaxial perfectly matched layers. The practical viability of the proposed simulation approach is demonstrated through its application to complex 3D models, involving pronounced topography along the air–soil interface and strong heterogeneity in the probed surficial region."

    "title": "Multifidelity uncertainty quantification for ice sheet simulations",
    "abstract": "Ice sheet simulations suffer from vast parametric uncertainties, such as the basal sliding boundary condition or geothermal heat flux. Quantifying the resulting uncertainties in predictions is of utmost importance to support judicious decision-making, but high-fidelity simulations are too expensive to embed within uncertainty quantification (UQ) computations. UQ methods typically employ Monte Carlo simulation to estimate statistics of interest, which requires hundreds (or more) of ice sheet simulations. Cheaper low-fidelity models are readily available (e.g., approximated physics, coarser meshes), but replacing the high-fidelity model with a lower fidelity surrogate introduces bias, which means that UQ results generated with a low-fidelity model cannot be rigorously trusted. Multifidelity UQ retains the high-fidelity model but expands the estimator to shift computations to low-fidelity models, while still guaranteeing an unbiased estimate. Through this exploitation of multiple models, multifidelity estimators guarantee a target accuracy at reduced computational cost. This paper presents a comprehensive multifidelity UQ framework for ice sheet simulations. We present three multifidelity UQ approaches—Multifidelity Monte Carlo, Multilevel Monte Carlo, and the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator—that enable tractable UQ for continental-scale ice sheet simulations. We demonstrate the techniques on a model of the Greenland ice sheet to estimate the 2015-2050 ice mass loss, verify their estimates through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, and give a comparative performance analysis. For a target accuracy equivalent to 1 mm sea level rise contribution at 95 % confidence, the multifidelity estimators achieve computational speedups of two orders of magnitude."

This paper also discusses unavoidable changes in the near future concerning AI, such as the fast evolution of AI foundation models and AI laws, and how the Earth and environmental community should adapt to these changes. This paper provides an important reference to the geospatial data science community to adjust their research road maps, find best practices, boost the FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) aspects of AI research, and reasonably allocate human and computational resources to increase the practicality and efficiency of Earth AI research."

    "title": "A sensitivity analysis of the impact of shut-in water cut of reactive control on net present value of waterflooding under reservoir uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Reactive Control (RC) is a well-known strategy for oil production optimization for waterflooding. This strategy is simple and direct: to set the producers and injectors to the maximum allowable flow rates, and to shut producers that become uneconomic due to exceeding a Shut-in Water Cut (SWCT) threshold; the RC with this SWCT will be called Classical RC (Cla-RC). This approach is also applied in waterflooding under uncertainty, which is represented by multiple realizations of the reservoir, and the same control must be applied on all realizations. Despite its great importance and its popularity, RC has received scant attention in the literature and its SWCT is always a constant value for all producers given by the Cla-RC. Thus, we present a sensitivity analysis of the impact of SWCT of RC on Net Present Value (NPV) of waterflooding under reservoir uncertainty. The research comprises two main parts. First, a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the NPV across various SWCTs with constant values for all wells. Second, based on the insights from the sensitivity analysis, three Progressive Reactive Control (PRC) techniques were developed to further increase the NPV. These techniques shut the producers at increasing SWCTs, from a minimum SWCT (to be set up) to the maximum SWCT, which is the one used by the Cla-RC; each PRC has its own distribution for defining the intermediate SWCTs. The results demonstrate that the optimal SWCT for RC and PRC can be determined efficiently with a few simulation runs, as the NPV curve exhibits a concave curve in relationship with SWCT and minimum SWCT, respectively. Although the Cla-RC strategy achieved the highest total oil production, it did not yield the maximum NPV. In fact, its NPV fell within the range of the lowest NPV values observed among the evaluated approaches. This study was validated by simulation of two of the major waterflooding challenges under reservoir uncertainty, Olympus and Egg Models. The best PRC technique achieved an NPV improvement of 0.5% compared to the optimal RC strategy. While the improvements observed for Egg and Olympus were 3.0% and 4.2%, respectively, relative to the Cla-RC."

    "title": "Incorporating spatial variability in surface runoff modeling with new DEM-based distributed approaches",
    "abstract": "This study introduces two novel DEM-based distributed rainfall-runoff models derived from the existing Hidropixel model: Hidropixel TUH+ and Hidropixel DLR . These models account for spatial variations in direct runoff generation, translation, and storage within a watershed, considering spatial variability in rainfall and basin characteristics. In Hidropixel TUH+ , a Triangular Unit Hydrograph (TUH) is determined for each Digital Elevation Model (DEM) pixel and lagged to the watershed outlet based on the travel time from the pixel to the outlet. In Hidropixel DLR , a hydrograph is estimated for each pixel based on the travel time, which takes translation effects into account. To represent the storage effects, this hydrograph is attenuated by a linear reservoir at each pixel. Both approaches were applied to the Upper Medway catchment (250 km 2 ) in southeastern England, using rainfall data from a rain gauge network. The outcomes revealed that the proposed approaches provided a reasonably accurate prediction of the hydrographs and exhibited notably superior performance compared to the original version of Hidropixel, which has limited capabilities in capturing translation effects. Hidropixel TUH+ and Hidropixel DLR predicted peak flows with an average absolute error of 11% and 10%, respectively. The Hidropixel DLR achieved a more accurate time-to-peak estimation, with an average absolute error of 1 h, compared to the 1.5-h error from Hidropixel TUH+ . Additionally, the Hidropixel DLR predicted the full direct runoff hydrograph more accurately, achieving an average Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient ( NSE ) of 0.89, while the Hidropixel TUH+ had an NSE of approximately 0.84."

    "abstract": "A Bayesian inference approach for inferring the source of marine pollution released from a moving source in an uncertain flow field is proposed. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed and applied for inferring single and multiple release events from vessels moving at known velocity along a predefined path in the Mediterranean Sea. The likelihood is based on a logistic regression cost function that measures the discrepancy between the modeled spill distribution and a binary representation of the observed images. We assess the performance of the proposed methodology using a synthetic release scenario employing realistic ocean currents to drive a stochastic Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) algorithm to generate a probabilistic representation of the spill distribution. The MCMC algorithm employs an adaptive scheme to robustly ensure convergence and well-mixed chains. The proposed Bayesian framework is tested by inferring the location, or injection time, and relative contributions of single and multiple moving sources, contributing to separate and common observation patches, with a focus on various scenarios that demonstrate the efficiency of our sampling algorithm. The performance of the proposed framework was further assessed by comparing the model predictions with the most probable release parameters predicted by a global optimization algorithm."

    "title": "Deep learning surrogate for predicting hydraulic conductivity tensors from stochastic discrete fracture-matrix models",
    "abstract": "Simulating water flow in fractured crystalline rock requires tackling its stochastic nature. We aim to utilize the multilevel Monte Carlo method for cost-effective estimation of simulation statistics. This multiscale approach entails upscaling of fracture hydraulic conductivity by homogenization. In this work, we replace 2D numerical homogenization based on the discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) approach with a surrogate model to expedite computations. We employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a deep feed-forward neural network as the surrogate. The equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor \\(\\varvec{K}^{\\varvec{eq}}\\) is predicted based on the input tensorial spatial random fields (SRFs) of hydraulic conductivities, along with the cross-section and hydraulic conductivity of fractures. Three independent surrogates with the same architecture are trained, each with a different ratio of fracture-to-matrix hydraulic conductivity \\(\\varvec{K}_{\\varvec{f}}\\varvec{/}\\varvec{K}_{\\varvec{m}}\\) . As the ratio \\(\\varvec{K}_{\\varvec{f}}\\varvec{/}\\varvec{K}_{\\varvec{m}}\\) increases, the distribution of \\(\\varvec{K}^{\\varvec{eq}}\\) becomes more complex, leading to a decline in the prediction accuracy of the surrogates. The prediction accuracy improves as the fracture density decreases, regardless of the \\(\\varvec{K}_{\\varvec{f}}\\varvec{/}\\varvec{K}_{\\varvec{m}}\\) . We also investigate prediction accuracy for different correlation lengths of input SRFs. The observed speedup gained by surrogates varies from \\(\\varvec{4}\\varvec{\\times }\\) to \\(\\varvec{28}\\varvec{\\times }\\) depending on the number of homogenization blocks. Upscaling by numerical homogenization and surrogate modeling is compared on two macroscale problems. For the first one, the accuracy of outcomes is directly correlated with the accuracy of \\(\\varvec{K}^{\\varvec{eq}}\\) predictions. For the latter one, we observe only a mild impact of the upscaling method on the accuracy of the results."

    "abstract": "The transient electromagnetic method is widely used in diverse fields, including mineral and groundwater exploration, environmental studies, geothermal investigations, and near-surface surveys. The subsurface is often assumed to be isotropic; however, it becomes essential to consider electrical anisotropy when dealing with complex media like layered or fractured models. Fortunately, the progress in computational power and advanced algorithms have significantly enhanced our ability to improve forward modeling in complex media. The Spectral Element Method (SEM) has been very successful for seismic modeling, and its suitability for other geophysical methods has been the focus of recent research. We investigate the applicability of SEM to model three-dimensional transient electromagnetic fields on isotropic and anisotropic geophysical media; we also test the explicit finite-difference method for time stepping. We compare in our experiments nodal basis functions of up to order 8 for different scenarios using \\(\\varvec{x}\\) - and \\(\\varvec{z}\\) -polarized electric dipoles as sources. We find that using higher-order polynomial basis functions and finite-difference time stepping yields accurate results. Specifically, 2nd and 4th-order basis using coarse meshes provide better results than a finer mesh with first-order polynomials. The finite-difference method is conditionally stable and computationally efficient since it does not require solving a system of linear equations."

    "abstract": "Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) stands as a nonlinear, high-resolution technology for subsurface imaging via surface-recorded data. This paper introduces an augmented Lagrangian dual formulation for FWI, rooted in the viewpoint that Lagrange multipliers serve as fundamental unknowns for the accurate linearization of the FWI problem. Once these multipliers are estimated, the determination of model parameters becomes simple. Therefore, unlike traditional primal algorithms, the proposed dual method circumvents direct engagement with model parameters or wavefields, instead tackling the estimation of Lagrange multipliers through a gradient ascent iteration. This approach yields two significant advantages: i) The background model remains fixed, requiring only one LU matrix factorization for each frequency inversion. ii) The convergence of the algorithm can be improved by leveraging techniques like quasi-Newton l-BFGS methods and Anderson acceleration. Numerical examples from acoustic and elastic FWI utilizing different benchmark models are provided, showing that the dual algorithm converges quickly and requires fewer computations than the standard primal algorithm."

    "abstract": "Seismic imaging is a major challenge in geophysics with broad applications. It involves solving wave propagation equations with absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) multiple times. This drives the need for accurate and efficient numerical methods. This study examines a collection of exponential integration methods, known for their good numerical properties on wave representation, to investigate their efficacy in solving the wave equation with ABC. The purpose of this research is to assess the performance of these methods. We compare a recently proposed Exponential Integration based on Faber polynomials with well-established Krylov exponential methods alongside a high-order Runge-Kutta scheme and low-order classical methods. Through our analysis, we found that the exponential integrator based on the Krylov subspace exhibits the best convergence results among the high-order methods. We also discovered that high-order methods can achieve computational efficiency similar to low-order methods while allowing for considerably larger time steps. Most importantly, the possibility of undertaking large time steps could be used for important memory savings in full waveform inversion imaging problems."

    "abstract": "The Middle Andaman region of the Andaman Islands is of considerable geological and ecological significance. This study provides a comprehensive geochemical and mineralogical analysis of major oxides and trace elements in soil and rock samples from ophiolitic and sedimentary formations. A total of 24 samples were collected and analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thin section analysis to assess their composition and distribution. Dominant major oxides identified include silica (SiO₂), alumina (Al₂O₃), and iron oxide (Fe₂O₃), which are typically associated with felsic volcanic and sedimentary formations. Trace elements are found in the following order of abundance: Cr, Ba, Zr, Zn, V, Ni, Rb, Sr, Pb, Co, Th, and Sc. Mineralogical investigations reveal key minerals such as albite, biotite, garnet, kyanite, chromite, and celestite, indicating volcanic and sedimentary origins, with a complex geological history shaped by a semi-arid to semi-humid climate. Geochemical analysis suggests moderate to intense weathering, reflected in the chemical index of alteration (CIA) values. Dissolution of undersaturated minerals like calcite and gibbsite influences groundwater chemistry, while oversaturated minerals such as halite and manganese oxides precipitate, affecting groundwater flow and aquifer permeability. Trace metals, including iron, manganese, cadmium, and lead, indicate both natural and anthropogenic influences. These findings underscore the need for ongoing geochemical monitoring and integrated management strategies for sustainable groundwater and marine resource management in the region."

    "title": "Minimum acceptance criteria for subsurface scenario-based uncertainty models from single image generative adversarial networks (SinGAN)",
    "abstract": "Evaluating and checking subsurface models is essential before their use to support optimum subsurface development decision making. Conventional geostatistical modeling workflows (e.g., two-point variogram-based geostatistics and multiple-point statistics) may fail to reproduce complex realistic geological patterns (e.g., channels), or be constrained by the limited training images and computational cost. Deep learning, specifically generative adversarial network (GAN), has been applied for subsurface modeling due to its ability to reproduce spatial and geological patterns, but may fail to reproduce commonly observed nonstationary subsurface patterns and often rely on many training images with the inability to explore realizations around specific geological scenarios. We propose an enhanced model checking workflow demonstrated by evaluating the performance of single image GAN (SinGAN)-based 2D image realizations for the case of channelized subsurface reservoirs to support robust uncertainty around geological scenarios. The SinGAN is able to generate nonstationary realizations from a single training image. Our minimum acceptance criteria expand on the work of Leuangthong, Boisvert, and others tailored to the nonstationary, single training image approach of SinGAN by evaluating the facies proportion, spatial continuity, and multiple-point statistics through histogram, semivariogram, and n-point histogram, along with evaluating the nonstationarity reproduction through multiple distribution checks ranging from local scale pixel distribution to multiscale local distribution. Additionally, our workflow incorporates reduced-dimensionality analysis through self-attention, providing a flexible approach for deep learning-based enhanced model realization to single training image comparison. With our proposed workflows, the robust application of SinGAN is possible to explore uncertainty around geological scenarios."

    "title": "Metallogenic environment for lithium mineralisation in bauxite from Salal-Haimna area, Reasi, North West Himalaya of Jammu-Kashmir, India",
    "abstract": "The Salal-Haimna area in the northwestern Himalaya (Jammu and Kashmir) hosts India’s first reported occurrence of sedimentary-type lithium-bearing bauxite, assigned to the Cretaceous–Eocene age. The bauxite overlies the Jangalgali Formation, which consists of chert–quartzite breccia resting unconformably on the Proterozoic Sirban Limestone. Although previously evaluated as a medium-grade lithium prospect with an average lithium concentration of 583 ppm (maximum 2847 ppm), the genetic framework of lithium mineralisation had remained poorly understood. The present study aims to determine the source and mechanism of lithium enrichment. Geological traverses revealed the presence of tuffite interbedded with quartzite and chert breccia. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the bauxite is mineralogically composed of kaolinite, illite, and diaspore, with minor boehmite, montmorillonite, and chlorite. Lithium concentrations are notably higher in the clay-rich matrix (503 ppm) than in pisolites (325 ppm), identifying the matrix as the primary lithium host. Laser Ablation ICP-MS analyses confirm kaolinite as the dominant lithium-bearing phase. Petrographic and SEM studies of the tuffite and claystone reveal volcanic features such as glass shards, vitric fragments, and Pele’s hair within a fine-grained groundmass of clay and quartz, suggesting a pyroclastic, acidic volcanic origin. The quartz grains are amoeboid shaped with embayed margins and fuzzy irregular outline. The study establishes that these altered volcanic rocks are the source of lithium, which was mobilised through weathering and subsequently adsorbed by clay minerals within the bauxite. The lithium enrichment in the Salal-Haimna bauxite is the result of eluviation from volcanic precursors and secondary concentration within clay-rich horizons. This study offers new insights for critical mineral exploration in lateritic bauxites."

Due to its permo-porosity characteristics, the free-flow regions, represented by fractures and vugs embedded within the porous matrix, make multiphase flow modeling challenging. This study compares different approaches that can be used to describe two-phase flow through vugular porous media. Brinkman equation is used to describe physical phenomena considering both flow through the porous matrix and through free-flow regions. The predictions obtained with Brinkman model are compared with two different Darcy models: heterogeneous and homogeneous. In the heterogeneous Darcy model, the vugular region is characterized as a porous medium with high porosity and permeability. In the homogeneous Darcy model, the complex two-phase flow through the vugular domain is represented by an equivalent absolute permeability and relative permeability curves. The accuracy of the homogenization procedure is evaluated as a function of vug configuration."

    "abstract": "Water is essential for life, and its dearth is a huge worldwide concern. This study investigates the availability, usage, and quality of water resources across five districts—Jammu, Kathua, Samba, Doda, and Rajouri—within the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, India. The primary objective is to assess regional disparities in water accessibility and management practices, identify the underlying causes of water scarcity, and document community-driven solutions. Using a semi-quantitative survey, data were collected from 2,250 households across 150 villages using structured questionnaires and field observations. The results reveal that water scarcity in the region is primarily driven by seasonal variations (reported by 76% of respondents), global warming (16%), and over-exploitation of water sources (7%). Water quality is a major concern, with Samba district reporting 100% of its surveyed population identifying drinking water as poor or very poor in quality. In contrast, Doda exhibited relatively better water quality with higher reliance on spring and canal water. Per capita water consumption varied significantly by elevation and district, ranging from 90 to 280 L per day. Groundwater analysis showed mixed trends, with some areas recording rises (up to 13.12 m) and others declines (up to 3.54 m) over the past decade. The study emphasizes the urgent need for localized water governance, restoration of traditional water harvesting systems, afforestation, and implementation of check dams. These findings provide a foundation for informed policymaking and sustainable water resource management tailored to the region’s diverse physiographic and climatic conditions."

    "abstract": "Identifying coastal sectors prone to impacts due to climate change is essential for decision-making, especially in the current context of increasing occupation of these areas. Although coastal plains associated with estuaries are ecologically and economically important, methodologies that analyze their integrated vulnerability to both erosion and flooding events are scarce. This article presents a method to assess the physical vulnerability of the area adjacent to the estuarine portion of the Itajaí-Açu River, Santa Catarina, Brazil (southern Brazil), in relation to these two sources of impact. The approach integrates geomorphological data, elevation, slope, and land use and land cover to identify areas vulnerable to extreme events. The results showed that 56% of the analyzed area has high or moderately high vulnerability and that the associated fluvial terraces have 52% of their surface classified as highly vulnerable. The predominant land use and land cover class is agriculture and pasture mosaic, corresponding to 35% of the total area, with 54% classified as highly vulnerable, indicating a need for special attention due to its economic importance. The developed methodology can be adapted and replicated to other estuaries, expanding its use and contributing to a more robust understanding of estuary vulnerability in various regions."

    "abstract": "Climate change has increased flood risks in downstream Nigeria, driven by altered hydrology, dam operations, and land-use changes threatening infrastructure, livelihoods, and ecosystem stability with growing frequency and severity. This study analyzes flood patterns, identifies key environmental drivers, and predicts flood-prone areas through an integrated machine learning and geospatial analysis approach. Data sources included Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1, rainfall measurements, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data, and surface water level records. Machine learning models Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied using geospatial tools such as Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS 10.5 to assess flood dynamics from 2018 to 2024. Downstream regions (elevation: 78–235.1 m) exhibited greater flood susceptibility than upstream areas (up to 1399.43 m). Flood extents rose by 10.9% in August (from 2441.91 km2 in 2018 to 2707.75 km2 in 2024) and by 39.8% in October (from 3083.44 km2 to 4311.55 km2). The RF model achieved the highest accuracy (92%), outperforming SVM (88%) and ANN (85%). Inundated areas increased from 20 to 35% of downstream zones. Rainfall intensity rose by 15–20%, with annual totals exceeding 4311 mm in some areas. Forest cover declined by 15–20%, further exacerbating flood risks. The findings demonstrate that climate change, land-use alteration, and dam operations are major contributors to flooding. Mitigation strategies include 10–15% reforestation, embankment construction, and machine learning–driven early warning systems, which can reduce flood damage by up to 30%. These approaches support sustainable flood risk management in Nigeria."

    "abstract": "We analyzed air quality data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) during 2010–2023, focusing on heat and non-heat wave periods. Our analysis covered 7 pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , NH 3 , SO 2 , CO, O 3 ) across 6 climate zones in India: Arid, Semiarid, Montane, Humid Subtropical, Tropical Wet, and Tropical Wet & Dry. Additionally, we reviewed annual CO 2 and GHG emissions in India from 1990 to 2022. Our findings showed that particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) had a greater impact during heat wave periods across all climate zones except the Tropical Wet zone. Arid, Semiarid, and Humid Subtropical zones exhibited poor air quality during both periods, with worse conditions during heat waves. In these zones, the likelihood of air quality categories like moderately polluted, poor, very poor, and severe was generally low in both periods, and the Montane zone showed a similar trend, though pollution worsened during heat waves. NH 3 pollution remained relatively stable with low variability, while PM 10 and PM 2.5 showed lower probability certainty and greater variability. The study also highlighted that rising CO 2 and GHG emissions contribute to increasing global surface temperatures and the intensification of heat waves. The Semiarid zone, particularly Delhi, had the highest pollution levels, whereas the Montane zone and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala recorded the lowest pollution levels."

    "abstract": "Urbanization’s profound impact on urban hydrology was investigated through a comprehensive spatial analysis of water body transformations in Dhaka Metropolitan Region from 2004 to 2021. The study aimed to quantify and map temporal changes in surface water bodies, employing advanced remote sensing techniques and manual digitization of Landsat satellite imagery with high-resolution GIS analysis. Utilizing short-wave infrared and near-infrared bands combined with meticulous manual digitization, researchers overcame limitations of traditional automated classification methods, providing more detailed water body delineation in complex urban landscapes. Results exposed a dramatic water body decline from 68.92 km² (22%) in 2004 to 29.41 km² (9%) in 2021, representing a significant 57.3% reduction. Spatial analysis revealed concentrated losses in rapidly urbanizing areas such as Moghbazar, Malibag, Rampura, and Uttara, with larger wetlands and natural lakes experiencing the most substantial degradation. The research identified critical environmental implications, including increased waterlogging vulnerability, reduced natural drainage capacity, and potential local climate variability. Comparative analysis with previous studies underscored an accelerated rate of water body loss, suggesting intensified urbanization pressures. The methodology not only provides detailed quantification of urban hydrological changes but also offers evidence-based recommendations for sustainable urban development. Findings emphasize the urgent need for integrated conservation strategies, strict zoning regulations, and comprehensive urban drainage master plans to mitigate ongoing environmental transformations in Dhaka’s urban landscape."

    "abstract": "This Part II serves as a companion pair for the Part I paper to provide further insights into the deformation behaviours of original and MICP-treated residual soil and sand, by using Acoustic Emission (AE). Special focus was placed on discerning the difference of mechanical behaviours between untreated and MICP-treated residual soils, by their changes of AE responses. A series of undrained triaxial tests same as those shown in Part I were simultaneously performed with the AE instrumentation. The developed AE measurement system was feasible for investigating the behavioural change relating to the soil fabric and correlating conventional mechanical measurements. In line with the finding from Part 1, the present AE analysis showed that the isotropic compression behaviour of MICP-treated residual soil was dominated by both elasticity and densification effect within soil pores. The MICP-treated residual soil tended to show more distinctive elastic behaviour by releasing less AE energy, as compared to the untreated counterpart because of the formation of elastic bonding and enhanced cementation that restricted the soil movement. This cementation effect was gradually diminished after the increase of consolidation stress due to the rearrangement of soil grains, partly associated with the mobility of adhered fines in soil bonding. The lightly treated residual soil manifested elasto-plastic shearing behaviour and preserved a greater extent of elasticity, as compared to the untreated residual soil. A distinctive elastic deformation behaviour was observed in the untreated and MICP-treated residual soils that subjected to over-consolidation effect. Upon the state of dilation and critical change of AE rate, the MICP-treated residual soil and sand possessed higher shear strength than the originally compacted soil."

    "abstract": "Nyiragongo volcano, situated dangerously close to the densely populated city of Goma, poses a constant and immediate threat. This research investigated the 2021 Nyiragongo eruption, employing a multi-faceted approach to characterize lava flow trajectories and the emission of deleterious gases (CO₂, CO, and NO₂). Methodologically, the study integrated field observations, satellite remote sensing via Google Earth Engine (GEE), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to delineate lava flow extents. Furthermore, in situ analyses documented structural damage to roadways in Goma and adjacent areas, attributed to seismic wave propagation. Despite the eruption’s relatively limited magnitude on May 20, 2021, field assessments revealed substantial localized devastation, particularly resulting from lava inundation of built infrastructure. The integration of GIS mapping into urban planning strategies is paramount for reconstruction initiatives in Goma and analogous regions. These geospatial analyses can delineate hazardous zones based on established lava flow patterns, thereby mitigating future infrastructural development in high-risk areas. While ground instruments are limited in their capacity to determine plume density and dispersal, critical parameters for eruption forecasting. Conversely, satellite remote sensing offers a synoptic perspective, enabling the monitoring of gas emission dynamics across extensive spatial domains. This study leveraged satellite imagery to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of volcanic gas halos associated with Nyiragongo volcano during pre-eruptive, eruptive, and post-eruptive phases of two distinct events. Comparative analysis of sequential satellite observations facilitated the identification of recurring patterns in gas density and distribution."

    "title": "A case study comparing approaches to mask satellite-derived bathymetry",
    "abstract": "Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is a cost-effective method for estimating water depth in inland and coastal waters, but is only applicable to optically shallow water (OSW). Determining the appropriate extent of SDB maps and the depth threshold for accurate SDB model predictions has therefore been a challenge for practical applications of SDB. Previous studies have used either a numeric cut-off value or manually delineated OSW to determine where to apply, and where not to apply, SDB models. We compared the use of a threshold applied to the predicted depth, automated delineation of OSW using a published model, and manual delineation of OSW, to determine which method of masking unsuitable pixels for SDB performs best. We used a water-leaving reflectance Sentinel-2 image of the St. Lawrence River, and a Random Forest model using neighbouring pixel information to predict SDB. We then compared the different approaches to masking unsuitable pixels in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE) of the retained predictions and the total mapped area. The application of a model-predicted depth threshold is easy to implement and achieved an MAE of 0.54 m, outperforming automated and manual OSW delineation methods, which had MAEs of 1.39 m and 1.64 m respectively over an approximately 100 km 2 study area. Future studies should further investigate these and other methods for masking pixels unsuitable for SDB under a wider range of environmental conditions."

    "title": "Hydrochemical characterization and seasonal variability of shallow groundwater in the Sokoto basin northern Nigeria rock weathering as a dominant control factor",
    "abstract": "Shallow groundwater in semi-arid basins shows significant hydrochemical variability, mainly influenced by seasonal changes and controlled dominantly by rock weathering processes. Seasonal variations in the hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater can be due to the interactions between internal geochemical processes and external factors such as rainfall and human activities. This study applied seasonal and multivariate statistical analyses to understand the hydrochemical controls on shallow groundwater. The study area was divided into three sub-basins, or clusters (i.e., Birnin kebbi, Sokoto, and Gusau). Fifteen shallow groundwater samples were derived from each cluster, totalling ninety shallow groundwater samples for the dry (April) and wet (July) seasons. The sampling periods have been chosen since they represent the peaks of the two seasons. Physical parameters, including Temperature, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and pH, were analysed in situ using handheld metres. However, chemical parameters (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + , K + , Fe 3+ , Cu 2+ , Zn 2+ , CO 3 − , HCO 3 − , Cl − , SO 4 2− , PO 4 3− , NH 3 and NO 3 − ) were analysed in the laboratory. These ions reveal hydrochemical processes, anthropogenic inputs, water-rock interactions, and pollution levels essential for evaluating groundwater quality and seasonal variability. Subsequently, statistics were applied to study the impact of seasonality and groundwater evolution. Results of the Mann-Whitney U test revealed that seasonality exerts a considerable influence on shallow groundwater through a significant difference in Temperature, EC, DO, TDS, HCO 3 − , Cl − , NH 3 and PO 4 3− . Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed strong relationships between hydrochemical elements, which suggest natural and anthropogenic influences on shallow groundwater evolution. Correlation results were concurrent with principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and Piper and Gibbs models. Therefore, this study inferred that seasonality and rock weathering are the primary mechanisms controlling shallow aquifers’ hydrochemistry in a semiarid Sokoto Basin, as revealed by the Gibbs model and statistical analysis. The positive correlations between nitrate and major cations in shallow aquifers suggest potential pollution from agricultural runoff or sewage sources, posing risks to water quality and human health (i.e., methemoglobinemia) and highlighting the need for integrated water resources management approaches to mitigate nutrient loading in these aquifers. The seasonal and multivariate statistics provide a framework for more accurate shallow groundwater quality analysis while considering multiple groundwater quality parameters under different environmental conditions. Seasonal and multivariate statistical analyses provide a user-friendly tool for monitoring shallow groundwater quality monitoring systems in global semiarid environments."

    "title": "Geospatial assessment of climate driven migration in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh",
    "abstract": "Climate-induced migration poses a growing challenge in Bangladesh’s southwest coastal region. This study aims to identify climate migration hotspots in Barguna District by analyzing both slow-onset (sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, temperature increase, erratic rainfall, waterlogging, and land degradation) and sudden-onset events (cyclones, floods, and riverbank erosion). A mixed-method framework integrating geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and machine learning was applied. Principal component analysis (PCA) explained 92.8% of the climate variance, whereas support vector machine (SVM) classification via Landsat 8 bands (5, 6, 7) effectively mapped migration risk zones with high accuracy (RMSS = 0.89). The key findings revealed significant climate trends: the temperature rose at 0.022 °C/year, the annual rainfall increased by 8.39 mm/year, the sea level rose at 4.19 mm/year, and the peak salinity reached 3.5 ds/m. Sudden hazards, including 30 cyclones (1875–2020), floods (3.91 m depth in 2020), and shoreline erosion (25.95 km lost), further triggered displacement. Migration is highest in areas exposed to riverbank erosion (228.61 sq. km), intense cyclones (229.09 sq. km), and overlapping cyclone and flood hazards (475.93 sq. km). Very high-risk zones (270.49 sq. km; 17.97%) are concentrated in Patharghata, Barguna Sadar, and Betagi. The results offer a spatial decision-support tool for policymakers to strengthen climate adaptation, disaster planning, and migration governance in coastal Bangladesh."

    "title": "Spatial prediction of groundwater potential area using fractal models, aeromagnetic and geospatial data in Tata Basin, Morocco",
    "abstract": "The necessity to safeguard groundwater resources in arid and semi-arid regions has driven the development of advanced spatial planning tools for mapping. This study aims to delineate potential groundwater zones (GWPA) in the Tata Basin, Morocco, utilizing the Data-Driven Multi-Index Overlay (DM IO ) model. The analysis incorporates nine conditioning factors: elevation, slope, proximity to rivers, proximity to lineaments, drainage density, permeability, lineament density, topographic wetness index (TWI), and lineament intersection density. Despite its utility, the GWPA mapping process is challenged by uncertainties inherent in these factors. To assess the impact of such uncertainties, three parameters (normalized density (Nd), weight (We), and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) were employed. The GWPA model classified the study area into five classes: very low (20.77%), low (44.78%), moderate (16.83%), high (13.97%), and very high (3.65%) groundwater potential. The model demonstrated a predictive capacity with Nd = 3.76 and We = 1.31, corroborated by the success curve analysis, thus confirming its reliability in GWPA mapping. Additionally, geological structures in the Tata Basin related to groundwater potential were analyzed using magnetic data processed with various filtering techniques. The results were consistent, further validating the model’s accuracy and dependability. These findings highlight the DM IO model’s efficacy in GWPA mapping and its potential application in other regions requiring sustainable groundwater resource management."

    "title": "Age of the granulitic metamorphism of the Nyong complex in the west border of Congo Craton, South Cameroon",
    "abstract": "Pressure and temperature conditions and electron microprobe analysis dating on monazite were conducted to investigate the age of the tectono-metamorphic events of Nyong Complex. The purpose of this work is to constrain P-T conditions and age to provide criteria for geodynamic models. The study area is made up of Paleoproterozoic metabasites, restricted Pan-African metasedimentary rocks and the rocks resulting from the melting of igneous rocks. This region displays a complex tectono-metamorphic evolution characterized by three phases of metamorphism associated with three deformational phases: The pre-D 1 phase (HP-HT: 784–860 °C, 12–13 kbar) implying its relationship with Archean. The D 1 phase (850 and 900 °C, 11–13 kbar) is a Paleoproterozoic event (1734 and 1893 Ma) that was developed under granulite facies metamorphic, implying that charnockitization took place in Paleoproterozoic. Charnockitization is a metamorphic process that transforms granitic rock into charnockite. The last stage D 2 (450–500 °C, 7–9 kbar) is Pan-African in age (577–677 Ma) and characterizes the amphibolite facies metamorphism (MP-MT). This implies that the deformation regimes initiated in Paleoproterozoic continue to Neoproterozoic. Paleoproterozoic ages and metamorphic conditions have similarity with those obtained in Ogooué Series (Gabon) and Transamazonian belt (NE Brazil), suggesting the correlation of the Nyong Series with the Ogooué metamorphic domain and the Transamazonian belt. The deformational structures are relevant to a part of a North-South collisional chain and open a debate about the Nyong Series’tectonic affinity. The regional significance of this study imply that the vast portions of Archaean materials have reworked under high-grade conditions during the Paleoproterozoic orogeny."

    "title": "A systematic literature review of land use and land cover dynamics in Manipur, India",
    "abstract": "Understanding land use and land cover change (LULCC) is essential for analyzing human-environment interactions. Manipur, located in Northeast India, is particularly sensitive to LULCC due to its ecological diversity and increasing anthropogenic pressures. This study systematically reviews existing literature to examine the trends, drivers, and implications of Land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics in the region. The review is based on 30 peer-reviewed studies selected through the ICA framework. Empirical studies focused on LULC within Manipur’s geographical boundary were included. Findings reveal an accelerated rate of LULC transformation across the state. Valley districts, including Imphal East, Imphal West, and Thoubal, show rapid urban expansion accompanied by significant declines in agricultural land, forests, and wetlands. In contrast, the hill districts like Ukhrul and Senapati display mixed patterns, with both forest degradation and notable regeneration reflecting conservation and afforestation efforts. Remote sensing and GIS were the primary tools used in these studies to detect land cover shifts and assess spatio-temporal patterns. Interconnected drivers such as population growth, infrastructure development, and economic activity continue to shape LULC transitions with considerable implications for air quality, land surface temperature, biodiversity, and ecological stability, particularly affecting sensitive zones such as Loktak Lake. This review underscores a notable research gap, characterized by the limited academic focus on hilly regions, and insufficient investigation into the underlying drivers and their socio-economic impacts. Bridging these gaps requires the integration of remote sensing data with socio-economic insights. The study examines the importance of implementing region-specific land management strategies, ecological restoration, and sustainable urban planning to enhance environmental resilience across the state."

    "title": "Hydro-geochemical assessment of the Nubian sandstone aquifer system for sustainable use in the western desert, Egypt",
    "abstract": "The vast Western Desert of Egypt may appear as an endless expanse of barren sand and rocky plateaus, but beneath this seemingly lifeless landscape lies one of the most significant water resources in North Africa i.e. the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS). Covering large portions of Egypt, Sudan, Chad, and Libya, the NSAS is a vast underground reservoir that plays a pivotal role in the water supply of Egypt's arid regions. The present study re-evaluates the hydro geochemical conditions of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer, focusing on water quality and its suitability for various uses. Hydro chemical analysis of 350 groundwater wells across the region involved the assessment of physical and chemical properties, Results indicate that most samples EC, TDS, pH, and concentrations of major anions and cations generally conform to (WHO) standards for drinking water. The high content of iron in the groundwater samples of the NSAS may be attributed to the iron-oxide minerals (Hematite and Magnetite) which is rich in the rocks of the western desert. Therefore, water treatment is necessary to reduce iron concentrations to levels suitable for drinking. A hydro-geochemical evaluation was carried out depending on statistical analyses. Additionally, Piper, and Schoeller diagrams were also used. Factor analysis revealed key factors contributing to groundwater quality variance across different regions, accounting for 58.1% in Bahariya, 46.73% in Farafra, 75.6% in Dakhla, 38.6% in Kharga, and 45.6% in Siwa. This study found that over-exploitation of groundwater will cause deterioration of groundwater quality due to over-pumping and therefore, the Nubian sandstone aquifer should be withdrawn based on the safe yield calculation in the aquifer."

    "abstract": "The March–April 2023 mudflow event in Ilemera-Gwanseli, Muleba, west of Lake Victoria within the western branch of the East African Rift System (EARS) in Tanzania, raised a question as to what extend the region is seismically active. This study examines the geological and geomorphological factors that contributed to the event, emphasizing on structural weaknesses and their link to active tectonic processes. Results show that the NE–SW to NNE–SSW trending faults represent an active extensional regime. A stress tensor model, derived from limited fault slip data, suggests normal faulting with SE-directed extensional forces, closely aligning with the observed mudflow trajectory. Conceptual modeling further reveals how the interplay between weathering, faulting and gravitational forces contributed to slope instability and mass movement. These findings highlight the ongoing neotectonic activity west of Lake Victoria and emphasize on the need to assess geohazard risks in the region. Integrating geological insights into land-use planning and disaster preparedness strategies is called for in order to mitigate future hazards and enhance community resilience."

    "title": "The geochemistry and element mobility during albitization and related uranium mineralization, Rohil deposit, Rajasthan, India",
    "abstract": "The albitite-hosted, Mesoproterozoic Rohil uranium deposit (Latitude: 27° 33′ 25ʺ N; Longitude: 75° 29′ 25ʺ E) is located in the Sikar district, Rajasthan of Western India. The predominant radioactive mineral found is uraninite, with smaller amounts of brannerite and coffinite. Uranium mineralization is hosted by albitized metasedimentary rocks such as quartzite, quartz-biotite schist, quartz-amphibole schist, and graphite schist. These rocks have undergone multiple alteration phases, including extensive albitization. The alteration patterns can be explained by sequential metasomatic processes: Na-metasomatic stage, Na-Ca-Mg metasomatic stage, and K-metasomatic stage. Significant mobility of most major and trace elements is indicated by the mineralogical, petrographic, and geochemical evidences. The whole-rock chemistry of altered samples and unaltered host rocks has been compared to determine the extent of metasomatic alteration in the rocks of the Rohil area. Compared to the unaltered rock, the albitites of Rohil show higher Na, Si, Al, Ca, Mg, Ti, K, and P contents, while Fe and Mn are depleted. Most of the selected trace elements show significant enrichment in albitites except Th and Cs. Hf and Ta were immobile during albitization. Albitites also show an enrichment of the total REE concentration, with the LREE relatively more enriched than the HREE. Albitite samples with high U content are significantly enriched in LREE. Uranium and a few other elements were transferred and deposited by the Na-Ca-Mg-rich fluids. In albitites, U-enrichment and constant Th/U ratios of < < 1, which decreased to 0.01, suggest that U was remobilized and later deposited by metasomatic-hydrothermal activity."

    "abstract": "Floods have been identified as one of the environmental challenges faced by several neighborhoods in Kaduna. This research aimed to map zones vulnerable to floods in Kaduna with the aid of GIS and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The data used in this research included ASTER Global-Digital Elevation Model and Landsat 8 Imagery (OLI/TIRS) data. The coordinates of historical flood events were obtained via a handheld GPS device. These images were used to generate nine (9) flood-causative factors, which were computed and analysed via the AHP. These factors include elevation, slope, drainage density, the topographic wetness index (TWI), the stream power index (SPI), distance from streams, distance from roads, land use/land cover, and the normalized difference vegetation index. The study revealed that 25.77% of Kaduna falls within the high flood vulnerability zones, whereas 60.31% and 13.36% fall within the moderate and low flood vulnerability zones, respectively. The flood validation revealed that all the historical floods captured fell within the high flood vulnerability zone, with an ROC score of 0.94. This study successfully mapped areas vulnerable to floods, which will be critical to stakeholders in policy and planning for mitigating flood disasters within Kaduna."

    "title": "Evidences of ductile to brittle deformation and syn-tectonic emplacement on the Neoarchean granitoids, Nalgonda area, Eastern Dharwar craton, southern India",
    "abstract": "Situated at the Eastern Dharwar craton in India, the Nalgonda area consists of Neoarchean granitoid plutons variably deformed and intruded by few mafic rocks. The principal rock types are granites, gneisses, migmatites, mylonites and synplutonic mafic and felsic dykes. Controversial chronology has been proposed for the deformation phases and the granite emplacement in the Dharwar craton in general and some specific areas of that craton in particular. Some authors proposed two deformation phases for the Dharwar craton and indicated the granite emplacement during the second deformation phase, while others were talking of about five deformation phases. This paper aims to contribute in the understanding of the petrography and deformation phases of the Nalgonda area and the granite emplacement conditions using field, petrographic and structural analysis. The granitoids underwent four deformation phases. The first deformation phase is marked by foliation in gneiss, immediately followed by the second phase of deformation marked by upright to recumbent folds with NE verging indicating thrusting towards the NE. The third phase is heterogeneous simple shear, in sinistral and dextral context marked by voluminous granitic magmas intruding into the gneisses substratum. The magmatic to mylonitic structures of Nalgonda granitoids are mostly parallel to the solid-state deformation features recognized in the granites and migmatites, indicating the emplacement of the granites during the D 3 transcurrent tectonics. The D 3 phase in the Nalgonda area corresponds to the regional D 2 deformation phase recorded in the Dharwar craton. The fourth phase is a brittle stage responsible for the emplacement of synplutonic mafic dykes and faults. Throughout the Nalgonda area, NNE trending dextral and NNW trending sinistral shears define a conjugate set of strike-slip shear zones. The E-W to NW-SE oblique compressional regime was responsible for the syntectonic emplacement of the granites along NW-SE corridor."

    "abstract": "Stochastic finite-fault ground motion simulation is extensively utilized across a range of scientific and engineering fields. The current theoretical modeling of corner frequency in the source spectrum model is flawed, as it fails to take the rupture velocity into account. We have modified the corner frequency model and established the source spectrum model considering the rupture velocity, which makes the source spectrum model more consistent in theory. We employed stochastic finite-fault simulation for the 2022 M w 6.6 Luding earthquake in China, analyzing data from 10 strong-motion stations located within 100 km of the epicenter, utilizing a stochastic finite-fault model that incorporates an updated corner frequency model. The obtained strong ground motion records are compared with those calculated by the stochastic finite-fault model (EXSIM), in time domain and frequency domain. At the same time, the percentage difference between the simulated PGA and the measured PGA was calculated. The results show that the strong ground motion records obtained by the updated EXSIM are closer to the real ones in the time domain, and the strong ground motion records calculated by the updated EXSIM and the EXSIM are both close to the real ones in the frequency domain."

    "title": "Hydration induced fracture growth and strength reduction in miocene shale with implications for slope stability",
    "abstract": "Shale constitutes a significant portion of exposed sedimentary rock, necessitating an understanding of its response to various geo-environmental conditions. In southeastern Bangladesh, the prevalence of Miocene shale, particularly in road cut sections, raises concerns regarding slope stability during the rainy season. This study investigates the influence of loosely packed silt layers within the silt-clay matrix of Miocene shale on its deformation behavior and mechanical properties when subjected to hydration. This study investigates the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of shale influenced by silt layer orientations and hydration levels. Laboratory experiments revealed that silt interlayers significantly affect fracture formation during water immersion, demonstrating shale’s sensitivity to aquatic environments. Notably, fractures initiated within minutes of immersion, with their development intricately linked to the orientation of silt layers. The analysis of deformational responses under stress highlighted that different silt layer configurations lead to varied fracture mechanisms, emphasizing the complex interplay between structural orientation and material behavior. Fractures in shale develop within 2 to 15 min of water immersion, highlighting the material’s sensitivity to aquatic conditions. The orientation of silt layers significantly influences the growth of these fractures in water, while hydration is shown to reduce shale strength by 86–87%, which has a considerable impact on stability. The hydration level and strength reduction were investigated and a 3.5% hydration level results in an 80% loss of strength in shale. Furthermore, elastoplastic analysis suggests that such a reduction in strength may lead to slope failure, underscoring the critical relationship between hydration, silt layer orientation, and the mechanical integrity of shale. These findings underscore the importance of considering both hydration and silt layer orientation in assessing shale behavior, particularly in geotechnical applications where water exposure is critical."

The methodology integrates three key components: An Exposure Index utilizing CHIRPS rainfall data, a Sensitivity Index derived from NDVI data, and an Adaptive Capacity Index incorporating soil moisture data, terrain characteristics, and water body proximity. Applied to Rajasthan, India for 2015, the analysis reveals a distinct east-west Agricultural Drought Vulnerability Index with western districts showing the highest vulnerability (Jaisalmer: 0.78, Barmer: 0.75). District-level classification shows 6 districts (18.8%) falling under Very Low vulnerability covering 13.2% of area, 16 districts under Low vulnerability spanning 34.6% of area, 5 districts (15.6%) experiencing Moderate vulnerability across 18.8% of area, and 5 districts (15.6%) facing High vulnerability affecting 33.5% of area. This agricultural drought vulnerability assessment enables targeted interventions including customized crop insurance programs and district-specific drought management strategies through the framework’s automated processing and near real-time monitoring capabilities."

    "title": "Assessing land degradation in lower gangetic west bengal using GIS-based soft computing and advanced machine learning algorithms",
    "abstract": "Land degradation is the cumulative result of several physical and anthropogenic factors combined with adversity in many nations worldwide, particularly in developing nations like India. This study investigates land degradation in lower Gangetic West Bengal, an eastern Indian state, which has received limited attention. Two advanced machine learning models were used: the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) and the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN). Traditional approaches, like the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), are prone to subjective bias. Similarly, models like Random Forest and REPTree often fail to capture complex nonlinear relationships. The applied neural networks overcome these drawbacks. A total of 179,916 samples were analyzed. Among them, 25.85 percent were degradation points and 74.15 percent were non-degradation points. Eleven geophysical and environmental variables were selected based on literature and statistical evaluation. Land degradation zones were mapped using field surveys, published reports, and Google Earth imagery. Model performance was assessed using ROC-AUC curves and confusion matrix analysis on a 30 percent test dataset. The MLP-NN achieved an ROC-AUC of 85.20 percent and an accuracy of 88.90 percent. The RBF-NN obtained an ROC-AUC of 84.20 percent and an accuracy of 87.10 percent. Both models highlighted geology, rainfall erosivity, elevation, soil moisture, land use and land cover as key determinants. These results present a reliable, data-driven method for land degradation assessment. The study offers actionable insights for sustainable land management. It also provides crucial policy implications. Regional planners can use these results to design conservation strategies that protect agriculture and improve environmental resilience in lower Gangetic West Bengal."

    "abstract": "The unsaturated properties of mine tailings establish a vital foundation for sustainable mining operations in a changing climate. This research aims to evaluate the physical and socio-environmental opportunities and risks associated with managing unsaturated mine tailings through climate-change-driven stewardship, with the ultimate objective of enhancing the sustainability and resilience of tailings storage facilities (TSFs). A total of 16 high-quality articles were selected following a rigorously conducted literature-based approach. These articles were selected based on their empirical and case-study focus on climate stressors, geotechnical performance, and sustainable tailings management procedures. The main findings indicate that enhanced precipitation, hot extreme temperatures, and degradation of permafrost have a combined effect that causes the structural integrity of TSFs to be eroded, thus increasing the risks of seepage, erosion, and collapse. The Fundão, Brumadinho and Mount Polley events clearly show that such climatic impact can cause long-term environmental pollution and extensive social chaos. Simultaneously, modern technologies, specifically, the increased laboratory characterisation, the improved numerical studies (e.g., SEEP/W, PLAXIS), innovative sensor networks, and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) observations have enhanced the ability to pre-empt and treat climate threats of tailings. Such remediating factors as microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP), multilayer cover and electro-dewatering measures have been empirically proven to strengthen the stability of dams and reduce ecological effects. The study proposes recommendations that accommodate real-time climate predictions and hydrological monitoring towards the TSF design. In addition, it promotes a new multidisciplinary paradigm that integrates geotechnical engineering, climate sciences and environmental health."

    "title": "Water quality and human health risk assessment of nitrate in the SAO watershed (West, Cameroon)",
    "abstract": "Water is a vital resource for food, agricultural and electrification needs. These needs, combined with population growth and water availability issues, contribute to the high demand for this natural resource, with the corollary of anthropogenic pollution, which degrades its quality. In this context, the present work aims to characterize water quality and assess its suitability for drinking and agricultural purposes using various indices. A total of 25 surface and groundwater samples were collected from the study area. These samples were subsequently analyzed using the HPLC ion chromatography method on a Dionex ICS-1100 to determine chemical parameters, including pH, TDS, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + , K + , Cl – , SO 4 2− , HCO 3 – , and NO 3 – . The pH levels are sometimes acidic and sometimes basic, which is not suitable for human consumption and exceeds the WHO standard. The order of dominant ions is Na + > Ca 2+ > Mg 2+ > K + > NH 4 + and NO 3 − > Cl − > SO 4 2− > F − > HCO 3 − > PO 4 3− . Water in the research area acquires mineralization through a variety of natural geochemical processes, such as weathering, dissolution, ion exchange processes, and human activity. PCA and various ion ratios reveal that water mineralization is characteristic of anthropogenic impacts and biogeochemical processes. The pollution index indicates that the entire study area is subject to pollution. Nitrate pollution indices reveal that the water sample tests are unsuitable and can cause methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome. The water of the study area is suitable for irrigation for almost all types of crops, with a possibility of limited sodium hazards."

    "title": "Assessment of groundwater rise zones using electrical resistivity for foundation stability analysis",
    "abstract": "Poor drainage conditions can lead to soil erosion and water infiltration, potentially compromising the stability of nearby buildings. This study aims to identify and characterize zones of rising groundwater at a construction site in southeastern Bangui, Central African Republic. The objective is to evaluate the potential impact of these zones on foundation stability and to guide the design of effective drainage systems. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was employed as the primary investigative method, using a Schlumberger array with 2-meter electrode spacing. This geophysical technique was selected due to its proven effectiveness in delineating subsurface structures and assessing groundwater flow patterns in complex geological settings. The ERT survey revealed three distinct layers: (i) weathered bedrock (236–750 Ω·m); (ii) fissured bedrock (750–2,400 Ω·m); and (iii) fresh bedrock (> 2,400 Ω·m). Zones of low resistivity (less than 236 Ω·m) indicated saturated areas likely associated with groundwater accumulation. Two aquifer systems were identified: a shallow weathered bedrock aquifer (2–4 m deep) and a deeper fissured aquifer. The shallow aquifers extend laterally 3–10 m, with a water table depth of 1.5–3 m. They lack hydraulic connectivity with the deeper system, which likely contributes to the observed rise in groundwater levels. These findings underscore the importance of detailed hydrogeophysical surveys in construction planning. Rising groundwater, resulting from isolated aquifer systems, can threaten the structural integrity of foundations. The results inform the design of more resilient drainage infrastructure and highlight the need for ongoing hydrogeological monitoring, particularly of piezometric levels and flow dynamics, to ensure the site’s long-term ."

    "title": "Soil erosion vulnerability analysis of Damodar River Basin, India using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in Google Earth Engine (GEE)",
    "abstract": "Soil erosion is an important environmental issue worldwide. Therefore, data on spatio-temporal patterns of soil erosion and successive soil loss would be of immense significance for the sustainable management of land and water resources. Despite being coal mining-intensive area, Damodar River Basin of India, suffers with the lack of adequate measurements of soil erosion over the entire basin, which hampers the holistic planning and conservation initiative. Therefore, present study employs the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS), massive databases and processing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and attempts to estimate the soil loss in the entire basin. To estimate soil loss for the years 2017 and 2024 for the study area, RUSLE considers several factors, including the steepness factor (S), crop/cover management component (C), rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), slope length (L), and conservation support practice factor (P). The mean soil loss in the Damodar River Basin is decreased from 12.86 t ha⁻ 1 yr⁻ 1 in 2017 to 12.06 t ha⁻ 1 yr⁻ 1 in 2024. The present study identifies areas affected by prominent soil loss (> 20 t ha⁻ 1 yr⁻ 1 ) covering 36.47% of the total area in 2017 mostly concentrated on northwestern and central region of the entire basin with extensive mining activities, which slightly declined to 35.07% in 2024. Among all the factors, R factor is the primary reason for such decline which is attributed to the decrease in rainfall in the study area. The findings underscore the urgent need for focused soil conservation measures in the Damodar River Basin, considering its ecological relevance and socioeconomic worth. Due to the limitations in obtaining comprehensive field observations, across such an immense river basin, might affect the accuracy of predictions using the RUSLE model. However, present study estimates soil loss and identify vulnerable zone over two time periods within the expansive and mining-scarred river basin to enhance the reliability of estimations and thus it may contribute to the development of viable strategies for the long-term management of the Damodar River Basin's natural resources."

    "title": "Mechanistic comparisons of MICP-treated residual soil and sand Part I: microstructural formation and deformation behaviour of soils",
    "abstract": "The application of MICP in improving fine-grained soil or soil containing fines, such as clay or residual soil, has increasingly drawn attention in recent years. However, there are still very few studies focusing on the comparison between the behavior of MICP-treated soil containing fines and the more extensively studied MICP-treated sand. This study investigates the differences in microstructural formation and deformation behavior between untreated and MICP-treated residual soil and sand through a series of monotonic undrained triaxial tests. The untreated and MICP-treated soils were prepared in a dense state (approximately 80% relative density) and subjected to three levels of consolidation pressure (i.e., 40 kPa, 120 kPa, and 220 kPa) before being sheared under undrained conditions. A significant improvement in mechanical behavior was observed in the bio-treated residual soil, despite the precipitation of a low calcium carbonate content (< 5.0%). This finding is promising for field applications of MICP ground improvement technology in residual soils, which are typically characterized by appreciable fines content and lower permeability than sand. The results indicate that the isotropic compression behavior and undrained compressive strength of the MICP-treated residual soil were significantly enhanced. The MICP-treated residual soil exhibited more isotropic deformation behavior and developed an elastic soil fabric, in contrast to the untreated counterpart, which displayed anisotropic behavior. From a practical perspective, the lightly treated residual soil behaved like a dense soil due to the densification effect within the pore structure and enhanced interparticle strength. Although the mechanical behavior of dense sand remained largely unaltered, certain insights were gained that will be useful for comparison with the microstructure of residual soil."

    "title": "A geotechnical investigation on a recent gigantic rock avalanche at the Patalganga-Langsi site on the Badrinath highway of chamoli, Uttarakhand (Garhwal Himalaya), India",
    "abstract": "Garhwal Himalaya is one of the most landslide-prone regions in the Himalayan Belt due to its seismo-tectonic background, geological complexity, climate, geomorphological setting and large-scale human interference. A gigantic rock avalanche happened on July 10, 2024, near Patalganga-Langsi Tunnel on the Badrinath Highway (NH-7) of the Chamoli district and disconnected the Joshimath, Badrinath, and Nanda Devi National Park for a few hours. This road corridor is a significant gateway for valued pilgrimage destinations and Indo-Tibet Border security. A detailed investigation has been done on the recent reactivated rock cum debris avalanche at the Patalganga-Langsi Tunnel site. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model identifies this area as a high landslide susceptible zone, and the entire Patalganga-Langsi is tectonically controlled by the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and other proximity minor thrusts. Rainfall and exposed slope conditions are the primary triggering factors behind this rock avalanche, and geologically, this slope is still vulnerable as the Factor of Safety (FoS) is near the threshold value (1.019). Subsequently, the Schmidt hammer rebound test showed poor rock strength (approximately 30 or sometimes below 30), and the rocks have numerous structural signatures, which make them more vulnerable. Results of kinematic analysis for the two studied road cut slopes (Slope 1 and 2) emphasized a tendency to wedge failure. After the geo-technical study and the hazard potential of the slide site, sustainable geo-environmental management techniques should be immediately executed to maintain the socio-economic lifeline as well as Indo-Tibetan Border security management. Geo-technical parameters of the Patalganga-Langsi site reflect that there is a very high probability of wedge-type rockfall and rock-cum-debris fall."

    "abstract": "This case study aims to understand the behavior of floods in Bihar during 2021, a state considered the most flood-prone in India. To analyze the flood extent, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) GRDH data was used to monitor the spread of floodwater over time. Water and non-water areas were classified using a fixed threshold on radar backscatter values ( \\(\\sigma _{0_{VV}}\\) dB), and the Absolute Spread of Water (ASW) was calculated at 12-day intervals. Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery was also utilized to support land cover classification, enhancing the accuracy of flood detection. Validation with official records showed that the estimated flood-affected population matched 89% of reported figures, while the image tile covered 87% of the affected districts. Two major flood peaks were observed: on 21st July and 14th August. The difference in flood timing across districts is largely due to the influence of the river Ganges and the Koshi river. Districts located farther from these rivers experienced early flooding driven by local rainfall, while those closer to the rivers faced delayed and prolonged inundation due to river discharge and backwater effects. The findings of the study maps the flood dynamics and their patterns precisely, so the mitigation from heavy flood aftermath could be planned using such a temporal rich study."

    "title": "A comprehensive review of tree cover mapping using satellite sensor data",
    "abstract": "Trees serve manifold ecosystem functions including climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, landscape restoration etc. yet are facing threats globally due to human intervention. As a result, effective conservation initiatives require quantifying both present and past extents of the tree cover. Remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning techniques appear to be effective in mapping and monitoring tree cover for the past few decades and offering advantages over traditional approaches. Despite extensive research on vegetation, mangroves, forest health, and urban forests, a comprehensive review focusing solely on remote sensing’s role in tree cover mapping is lacking. This review aims to fill that gap by providing an overview of the studies that mapped tree cover using remote sensing, and discusses spatial context, satellite sensors, classification approaches utilized for mapping tree cover. Literature search using Google Scholar showed that such studies are prevalent in every continent to major climatic domain. From coarse to high resolution satellite data (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, Worldview, ALOS PALSAR etc.) are used independently or with an integration depending on the purpose, availability, and economical feasibility. While Landsat has gained more popularity due to its historical record and free availability, it faces limitations in identifying small fragments of tree cover. A wide range of tree cover mapping methodologies are available, and can be classified into pixel-based or object-based to supervised or unsupervised classification approaches which include machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Nearest Neighbour (NN), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Ensemble etc. However, challenges exist in mapping tree cover using remote sensing. Future research should focus on improving classification performance by leveraging multi-source, high-resolution, multi-temporal, and multi-sensor data, embracing the evolving capabilities of remote sensing technologies along with artificial intelligence to enhance accuracy and ensure reliability in tree cover mapping."

    "title": "Hydrochemical assessment of groundwater quality using water quality index, irrigation indices, and corrosivity models in a hydrocarbon-impacted coastal aquifer",
    "abstract": "Coastal regions heavily involved in hydrocarbon extraction often depend on underlying aquifer reserves to meet domestic, agricultural, and industrial demands. These groundwater systems, however, face risks from saline intrusion and anthropogenic activities. This research aims to comprehensively assess groundwater hydrochemistry within a key hydrocarbon-affected coastal aquifer in Eastern Obolo, southern Nigeria, evaluating its suitability for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use. Groundwater samples from the region were analyzed for concentrations of major ions, heavy metals, and physicochemical parameters. The Water Quality Index (WQI) was used to assess the potability of groundwater sources. Sodium Percentage (%Na), Kelly’ s Ratio (KR), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), and Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR) were employed to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for agriculture and irrigation. The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) and Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) were used to determine groundwater suitability for industrial purposes. Results showed that groundwater had a WQI range of 27. 66 to 45. 79, indicating its suitability for domestic use. Although the water was generally classified as freshwater, oily surface films were observed on water sources, a possible result of geogenic processes. The results also revealed mixed suitability for agriculture based on %Na (1. 27 to 2. 02), KR (0. 23 to 0. 40), SAR (0. 40 to 0. 57), and MAR (95. 82 to 99. 99.88). LSI values (− 0. 42 to – 1. 53) and RSI (7. 73 to 9. 12) suggested a high corrosion potential, which poses risks to industrial infrastructure. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated significant interrelationships among the physicochemical parameters. This study provides novel insights into groundwater quality in a major coastal aquifer impacted by hydrocarbon activities and saline intrusion. It contributes to the limited global literature on integrated groundwater quality assessment in coastal sedimentary basins, especially in hydrocarbon-producing regions. The results highlight the importance of continuous groundwater monitoring to safeguard water resources for various uses."

    "abstract": "Water quality plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health and ensuring the availability of water resources. This research assesses the water quality within the Ranibundh CD Block, situated on the western edge of the Khatra Subdivision in the Bankura district of India. The research utilises Water Quality Index (WQI) using various physico-chemical parameters, such as pH, Total Iron (Fe), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Magnesium (Mg), Fluoride, Turbidity, and Total Hardness (TH). Water samples were collected from field sources and the West Bengal Public Health Engineering Department (WBPHED) throughout the pre-monsoon season of 2020, with 65 stations sampled across the study area. A total of 28 significant sites exhibiting the highest physicochemical values were chosen for a comprehensive assessment aimed at evaluating the overall status of water quality. The evaluation process involved classifying the water quality as either safe or unsafe through the application of the traditional weighted arithmetic index and the multi-attribute VIKOR methods. The VIKOR method was adopted as an alternative strategy for analysing water quality. To achieve the study’s primary objective of water quality-based spatial prioritisation, the Voronoi approach was employed, allowing for the delineation of areas influenced by each sample site about contaminants. The final spatial prioritization was based on Gram Panchayat-wise occurrences of safe water status. The results of this study aim to assist planners, managers, and specialists in formulating effective management strategies to ensure a sustainable supply of safe drinking water, thereby enhancing long-term community health and water security."

    "abstract": "Rural towns have significantly contributed to local and regional development. Geoheritage and geotourism are catalytic niche areas for local development. This paper contributes a geohistorical and geoheritage perspective to the small rural town of Middelburg in Eastern Cape Province. Using literature review and site exploration, this study provides a lever for the development of geoheritage and geotourism in Middelburg. Middelburg is a historical rural town connected through natural and cultural heritage dating back pre and post-colonial periods. Its geological heritage is proven by the presence of the Karoo sedimentary rocks of the Permian Balfour Formation of the Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group which includes mainly mudrock and sandstone. It is endowed with presence of Early Jurassic dolerite sills and dykes while wealth of fossil tetrapods, particularly therapsids, and plants of the Glossopteris flora of the Karoo Supergroup are well exposed throughout the study area. The outcome of investigations revealed the Tafelberg Mountain and surrounding landscapes, Lessinghoogte Pass, Lootsberg Pass, Valley of Desolation at Camdeboo National Park and Spandaukop as some of the important geoheritage sites within and around Middelburg. These natural assets are complemented by the Middelburg Museum, Karoo Origins: The Fossils Centre, Kitching Fossil Exploration Centre where geoducation and geoconservation is emphasised. This study underscores the untapped potential of Middelburg’s geoheritage in fostering socio-economic development through geotourism. It lays the foundation for a comprehensive geoheritage inventory and highlights the need for integrated conservation and tourism strategies to enhance the region’s cultural and economic vitality."

    "abstract": "This study examines Land Use and Land Cover (LU/LC) changes in the buffer zone of the Nambor Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam, India, from 1989 to 2021 using satellite imagery. The objective is to evaluate how these changes affect conservation and land management in the area. LU/LC was classified into five categories: vegetation cover, agricultural land, barren land, water bodies, and built-up areas. Landsat 4–5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images (30-meter resolution) for the years 1989, 2001, 2011, and 2021 were obtained from the USGS Earth Explorer. The images, in TIFF format, were processed using ArcGIS 10.7 to generate LU/LC maps. All images were standardized to the WGS84 coordinate system with a UTM Zone 46 North projection. The analysis shows a steady decrease in vegetation cover and an increase in barren land. Vegetation cover declined from 47.57% in 1989 to 36.45% in 2021. Barren land increased from 25.97 to 32.22% over the same period. Agricultural land showed variations across the years but had a net increase of 1,737.27 acres. Water bodies and built-up areas also expanded slightly. The change detection results confirm a growing trend of land being converted to different uses, while land losses varied by period. These changes pose potential threats to biodiversity and ecological stability. The study calls for immediate conservation actions and improved land use planning to protect the buffer zone of the Nambor Wildlife Sanctuary."

    "abstract": "Natural and anthropogenic factors intensify the impacts of land subsidence, making it a pressing concern in Uttarakhand, India. This issue has become increasingly alarming, with recent estimates indicating that subsidence in some regions has increased by up to 50%. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of land subsidence in Uttarakhand, with a specific focus on the crisis in Joshimath and other affected areas, such as Rishikesh. A detailed literature survey is conducted to elucidate the various manifestations of subsidence, including its impact on infrastructure, property, and environmental conditions. Joshimath, located in the Chamoli district, is of particular interest because of its position in seismic Zone V and its location in an ancient landslide zone. This study examines how subsidence in this area has led to infrastructure damage, property loss, and environmental degradation. In Rishikesh, issues such as heavy rainfall-induced subsidence have caused severe damage, including the collapse of buildings and the disruption of major highways. The review highlights key strategies that can prevent subsidence, such as enacting regulations on groundwater extraction, developing relocation plans for affected populations, and promoting water conservation and groundwater recharge. The goal of this paper is to find good ways to deal with and manage land subsidence in Uttarakhand by putting together existing research and suggesting steps that can be taken. This will help lessen its effects and stop it from happening again."

    "abstract": "Effective groundwater resource management in crystalline basement terrains requires accurate delineation of aquifer zones using high-resolution subsurface imaging. Conventional geophysical methods for groundwater exploration often face depth limitations, which hinder comprehensive groundwater assessment. This study integrates Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES), Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), and Audio-Magnetotelluric (AMT) methods to investigate groundwater potential at the proposed central library site of Achievers University, Owo, Nigeria. The objective was to overcome the depth limitations of conventional methods and improve subsurface resolution by combining the complementary strengths of the three methods. Three traverses of 50 m each were established, each containing two VES points, totaling six soundings. VES data revealed four lithological units like topsoil, lateritic/quartzite formation, weathered bedrock, and fractured bedrock indicating aquifer zones at depths greater than 25 m. Identified curve types (QQ, KH, HK, QH and KQ) were indicative of groundwater presence though with QQ and KQ requiring caution due to the possibility of less permeable formation. ERT results further delineated potential aquifer at depths of 30–50 m in traverses 1 and 3, and below 30 m in traverse 2. AMT survey extended the depth of investigation, revealing deeper aquifer systems between 60 and 100 m across all traverses. The integration of these geophysical methods provided a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface, combining the high near-surface resolution of VES and ERT with the deep penetration capability of AMT. The findings validate the presence the presence of both shallow and deep-seated aquifers and highlight the suitability of AMT in crystalline basement terrains. The study recommends the adoption of integrated geophysical methods for improved groundwater exploration and sustainable resource management in similar geological settings."

    "abstract": "Construction companies and the local population use the rocks as construction materials without considering their characteristics. However, characterizing these massifs levels before their use is essential to guarantee the quality and durability of the roads built. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the physico-mechanical properties of the rock massifs in the Ngaoundal area in order to ascertain their potential applications in different road construction fields. The methodology used consisted of macroscopic, microscopic and physico-mechanical characterisation of the various rock massifs in Ngaoundal. The rocks studied here are dolerite with a doleritic texture consisting of plagioclase, pyroxene and opaque minerals; granite with a light gray to pinkish appearance; and granite with a grainy to pegmatitic structure, composed of alkali feldspar, quartz, plagioclase, biotite, opaque minerals and finally cataclasites with a dark gray to greenish appearance under the microscope. This latter rock is mostly made up of crystals of quartz, plagioclase, potassium feldspar and amphibole. In geotechnical terms, bulk density varies from 1.416 to 1.502 kN/m 3 ; specific weight varies from 2.625 to 3.33 g/ cm 3 ; dynamic fragmentation varies from 20.30 to 33.10%; impact resistance varies from 24.45 to 44.20% and wear resistance varies from 7.25 to 38.6%. Regarding the materials’ geotechnical characteristics, it seems that, after comparison with geotechnical standards, the dolerite and the granite massif have excellent geotechnical parameters, which allow their use in road construction as materials for bitumen gravel, base courses and wearing courses for low-to-medium traffic T1–T3. On the other hand, the cataclasites encountered in Ngaoundal cannot be used for road construction because this massif is very altered."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the water quality and hydrogeological assessment for domestic use, irrigation, and drinking near the Barapukuria coal mine area. The groundwater table data from 2010 to 2021 revealed that it reached its lowest point (8.0 to 11.0 m) pre-monsoon and its highest (3.0 to 6.0 m) post-monsoon. The concentrations of major anions and cations, and the values of EC, DO, TDS, pH, and salinity, were found within the acceptable and allowable limits for all purposes, except for a small amount of Fe 2− and HCO 3 − , when conducting field investigation and laboratory analysis. Numerous noteworthy analyses were carried out, including Piper's trilinear diagram, US salinity chart, Durov diagram, and Wilcox diagram. The weathering of silicates, specifically crystalline dolomitic limestone and Ca-Mg silicates, is responsible for the dominance of ions in the sequence Na + > Mg 2+ > Ca 2+ > K + . Alkali-earth metals and weakly acidic anions are present, like early groundwater reserves, as the dominance of Na-K-HCO 3 and Mg-HCO 3 and less recently recharged water of Ca-HCO 3 , which has a mixed anion and cation dominance and temporary hardness. The computed values of TDS, EC, SAR, TH, PI, and CAI indicate excellent to good quality water and are acceptable for all purposes with a few anomalies in Na% (64.99 meq/L), MH (59.02 meq/L), and RSC (144.11 meq/L). Changes in groundwater quality and level are gradually lowering as mining continues, falling below the suction limit (> 7.5 m) for hand tube wells (HTWs) and eventually because groundwater is being used for power plants. Regular surface and groundwater quality and level monitoring is recommended around the mine area."

    "abstract": "It is essential to simulate and quantify the availability of water resources using hydrological model with reliable data. The current study successfully calibrated and validated the water balance of the Kosi River Basin using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. India Meteorological Department (IMD) daily gridded rainfall and monthly stream flow data were used to develop the model from 2000 to 2013. The model performed well with statistical value of Nash-Sutcliffe and correlation coefficient greater than 0.70 and 0.72 during calibration and 0.67 and 0.70 during validation respectively. The spatiotemporal variation of water budget component were estimated over study area. The result showed that approximately 35% of rainfall was lost by evapotranspiration to the rainfall received. The spatial variability map depicts that evapotranspiration loss was higher in northwestern region due to high vegetation. This study will enhance understanding of water budget component response on sparse rainguage network in hilly region of Uttarakhand. The study undertaken provides a reference framework for assessing water budgets in hilly regions with sparse rain gauge networks."

    "title": "Integrating remote sensing and machine learning to evaluate environmental drivers of post-fire vegetation recovery in the Mount Kenya forest",
    "abstract": "In recent decades, the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires have been linked to climate change and human activities. Understanding the dynamics of post-fire vegetation recovery (PVR) is therefore critical for forest ecosystem restoration and management. The present study analysed burn severities and investigated the impact of environmental variables on post-fire recovery (PVR) in the Mount Kenya Forest Ecosystem (MKFE). The Random Forest (RF) regression model was employed to predict PVR and identify factors that significantly contribute to PVR in the Mount Kenya Forest ecosystem. Landsat satellite imageries from 2011 to 2021 were used to classify burn severity into seven classes based on the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index. Climate data, soil organic carbon, and topographic variables were integrated into the RF model to predict trends in PVR. The RF model achieved excellent accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.9013 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0280 on the training dataset, and R² of 0.8753 and RMSE of 0.0406 on the validation set. The model further revealed a strong positive relationship between temperature and Land Surface Temperature (LST), as well as vegetation recovery. On the other hand, topographic variables demonstrated a strong negative relationship with vegetation recovery. The combined influence of topographic and temperature condition variables highlights the heterogeneous nature of recovery processes, hence the need for spatially targeted management strategies. These findings have significant implications for adaptive management strategies in tropical montane ecosystems facing increasing wildfire risks."

The review also explores the induced polarization (IP) and self-potential (SP) methods as complementary approaches. Despite their proven utility, electrical and seismic refraction approaches face limitations arising from lithological heterogeneities, complex geological settings, and inherent data uncertainties. These challenges highlight the need for multidisciplinary strategies, including methodological innovations and integrative data frameworks. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly applied to these geophysical methods, particularly joint ERT and SRT analyses, optimizing nonlinear inversion processes and improving the interpretation of complex subsurface conditions. The case studies presented in this review evaluate how supervised and unsupervised ML techniques enhance ERT and SRT by improving data interpretation, refining inversion accuracy, automating lithological differentiation, and predicting seismic velocity from resistivity data. The findings emphasize the growing significance of integrating traditional geophysical methods with data-driven approaches to improve subsurface modeling. Continued innovations in ERT and SRT methodologies, along with emerging computational tools and ML applications, will further enhance their effectiveness in geological, hydrological, environmental, and hazard assessments."

    "abstract": "This study presents high-resolution palynological investigations of thirty-six rock samples from the Siamwiinga and Sianyolo regions of the Permian Mid-Zambezi Basin, Southern Zambia. The aim was to establish biostratigraphic frameworks, characterize the paleoenvironment, and assess the palynological kerogen composition of potential source rocks. Palynological analysis of Madumabisa Mudstone, Shale, and Gwembe Coal Formation samples revealed five distinct palynoassemblages, including Striatopodocarpites–Osmondacites–Thymospora–Laevigatosporites–Gnetaceae pollenites sinuosus , Lundbladispora–Striatopodocarpites , Striatopodocarpites-Scheuringipollenites-Kendosporites striatus , Verrucosisporites-Striatopodocarpites-Scheuringipollenites and Calamospora-Kendosporites , indicative of Late, Middle, and Early Permian ages, respectively. Biostratigraphic correlations with analogous basins in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Australia, India, Oman, and China were established. The study identified several new taxa, including Kendosporites antiquus , Rhizomaspora radiata , and Hamiapollenites dettmannae . The diverse palynological assemblages and the presence of abundant terrestrial organic matter, particularly from gymnosperms, suggest the potential for hydrocarbon generation within the Permian sediments of the Mid-Zambezi Basin."

    "title": "Evaluation of physicochemical and Microbiological parameters in the remediation of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons using organic compost",
    "abstract": "The presence of contaminated sites is a critical issue in many places around the world, both in developed and developing countries. São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, has more than 6,000 registered contaminated sites. The main pollutants found are automotive fuels, especially hydrocarbons derived from petroleum. Among the various remediation techniques available, the addition of organic compost to contaminated soil stands out as an approach that incorporates sustainability principles. This compost can be used for bioremediation, as it favors and stimulates the growth of different populations of microorganisms capable of degrading a variety of contaminants. In Brazil and other countries with a tropical climate, there is great potential for the use of compost in remediation, due to the climatic characteristics, the physical-chemical properties of the soils and the significant amount of organic waste generated in the country. This study investigated the application of organic compost in the remediation of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons in a laboratory environment. To this end, an Oxisol was artificially contaminated with diesel oil (O1) and a mixture of bunker fuel oil, diesel and kerosene (O2), in two concentrations (10 g/kg and 100 g/kg), in addition to the application of organic compost, in two proportions (1:0.1 and 1:0.5). The results showed that, at the end of the experiment, the concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons were reduced by up to 90% in the diesel oil treatments over 91 days. The presence of organic compost led to an increase in the levels of organic matter, volatile solids, pH and electrical conductivity, as well as improving soil structure and increasing the development of microorganism populations. In this way, compost acted as a source of energy for the soil’s microorganisms and as a source of new metabolically active microorganisms, contributing to increased biodegradation rates. The results of this study indicate that the addition of organic compost is an effective strategy for the remediation of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons, promoting improvements in the physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil and, therefore, can be a sustainable technique with positive environmental, social and economic impacts."

    "title": "Geological and geotechnical characterization of clayey materials from Feutap (West Cameroon): suitability in ceramic industry",
    "abstract": "This study involves an extensive geological and geotechnical assessment of clayey materials from Feutap, West Cameroon, to establish their suitability for fire bricks. The field trip evaluated the thickness of each layer of clayey material along the profile; the structure and texture of the clayey materials were tested. The collected samples were then examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD); typical geotechnical tests were performed (grain size analysis, density, Atterberg limit, natural water content, porosity, and voice index); and bricks manufactured from this clayey material were sintered at 900, 1000, and 1100 °C, respectively. Water absorption, linear shrinkage, and flexural strength were the technological properties tested. The field trip indicated that the feutap clay is developed on the weathering profile level, with heights ranging from 02 to 28 m and a variety of hues. The structure ranges from angular to subangular polyhedral, and the texture is primarily clayey silt. The mineralogical examination revealed that kaolinite (25.8 to 90.71%), illite (5.5 to 29.42%), and montmorillonite (20 to 24.3%) were the most common clays minerals, with a few occurrences of goethite (3.8%), hematite (21.3 to 28.4%), calcite (24.8%), and magnetite (42.1 to 29.42%). The grain size study showed different proportions of fine sands (60% to 45%) and clays (40% to 57%). The plasticity index ranges from 35.73 and 72.47%. The density ranges between 2.49 and 2.87 g/cm 3 . The bulk density ranges from 0.89 to 1.11 g/cm 3 , while the voice index varies from 57.98 to 65.75%. International classifications such as HRB (High Research Board), LCPC (Central Civil Engineering Laboratory of Bridge and Highway), and GTR (Guide to Road Earthworks) all conclude that those clayey materials are silty soils. The empirical diagrams suggest that these clayey materials are suitable for ceramic applications. The firing brick test on five samples (F13; F14, F31, F32, F33) have shown that the water absorption decrease with the temperature of sintering (30.03 to 19.47%); the linear shrinkage range from 5 to 6.6% and the flexural strength increase with the temperature (1.75 to 7.7 Mpa). According to the lower limit of flexural strength recommendation, which is 5 Mpa, four clayey materials are suitable for producing bricks at temperatures above 1000 °C studied, while F31 requires correction to be suitable for firing brick at 1000 °C. In order to improve the properties of firing brick with those clays, crushing feldspar must be added to lower the sintering temperature and increase flexural strength."

    "title": "Developing functional relationships of corn growth and developmental responses to nitrogen nutrition for modeling",
    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N), one of the essential mineral elements, is involved in many biochemical processes and ultimately closely relates to agronomic yield. Our ability to monitor N concentrations in plants through direct tissue sampling or remote sensing has rapidly evolved as technology has advanced. However, functional relationships between morphological and physiological processes and tissue N have yet to be widely published and are needed to advance precision and predictive agricultural technologies further. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to determine the relationships between tissue N concentration and corn ( Zea mays L.) morphological and physiologic characteristics. Plants were grown in pots under optimal conditions in sunlit controlled-environment chambers but with varying N supplies. Plant growth, developmental, and physiologic properties were monitored weekly. Shoot N content differed among treatments and declined over time for all treatment levels. Photosynthesis declined as N content decreased, but these decreases were largely non-stomatal limiting. Reductions in N content were due to declining chlorophyll and N balance index values and increasing flavonoids and anthocyanins. Stem elongation and leaf expansion were highly sensitive to declining N content. Below the soil surface, root growth and development rates fell and held a quadratic relationship with N content. Roots were less sensitive at low N stress levels than plant growth above the soil surface. The functional relationships produced from this study could help update crop simulation models and apply them to emerging precision agriculture technologies."

    "title": "Re-evaluation of the stratigraphy, structural, and depositional environment of Kolmani field, Gongola sub-basin, northeast Nigeria using outcrop data, ditch cutting data, and well log data for enhanced hydrocarbon exploration",
    "abstract": "The stratigraphy, structural, and depositional environment of the Kolmani field have remained elusive despite ongoing oil and gas exploration in the basin. This study sought to provide a comprehensive re-evaluation of the stratigraphy, structural features, and depositional environment of Kolmani field, Gongola Sub-basin, Northeast Nigeria based on outcrop and ditch cuttings for enhanced hydrocarbon exploration. The outcrop studies revealed a diverse range of clastic and carbonate lithologies, representing various depositional facies. The facies associations of the Bima, Yolde, Pindiga, Gombe, and Kerri-Kerri Formations indicate deposition in environments transitioning from continental to marine settings. These formations predominantly consist of quartz arenites, which, despite their textural immaturity, suggest deposition in stable tectonic settings, such as continental shelves. Five different formations were mapped from the studied outcrops. The Bima Formation is characterized by fining upward facies associated with an erosional base and thin clay that suggests a braided river depositional environment. Overlying the Bima Formation is the Yolde Formation characterized by fining and coarsening upwards lithofacies with shallow marine ichnofacies that indicates estuary to shoreface environments. The Kanawa Member is characterized by interbedded packstone limestone and shale indicating a shallow marine environment with fluctuating depositional conditions. The Sandy Members (Dumbulwa and Deban Fulani Members) show trends of fining and coarsening upward with both wave and tide signatures that suggest a wave-to-tide dominated estuary. The Fika Shale with homogeneous calcareous shale indicates lagoonal or tidal flat conditions. The Gombe Formation shows a dominance of coarsening upward and associated facies association that suggest deposition in deltaic environments. The Kerri-Kerri Formation is characterized by fining upward and the associated facies suggest a braided river. Formation gas was found in the Bima, Yolde, and Gombe formations at depths of 8563 feet (0.35%), 5254 feet (0.31%), and 3306 feet (0.23%), respectively. Across the formations, the sandstones’ porosity and permeability might have been influenced due to the sandstone’s composition, more especially, the feldspars that easily modify porosity during diagenesis stages."

    "title": "Data driven frequency ratio modeling for iron-ore exploration using aster and aeromagnetic datasets in parts of Nasarawa, Northcentral Nigeria",
    "abstract": "This study used an integrated approach combining aeromagnetic, geological and remote sensing methods to analyze subsurface structures associated with Iron Ore mineralization in part of Akwanga, Nasarawa Northcentral Nigeria. The frequency ratio model (FR) was used to assign weights to different layers of evidence and develop a conceptual model of mineralization potential. Magnetic data enhancement techniques, including reduction to equator (RTE) and upward continuation (UC), were applied using Oasis Montaj™ software. Subsurface geological structures were revealed, and Euler Deconvolution estimated depths to magnetic sources. Band ratio analysis using ASTER Bands 2/1 (ferric oxide), 5/3+1/2 (ferrous oxide) and 7/5 (clay mineral) was employed to determine the hydrothermal alteration of Iron Ore. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to ASTER bands 1, 3, 5, 8 for propylitic alteration, Bands 1, 3, 4, 6 for Argillic alteration, and Bands 1, 2, 3, 4 for iron oxide alteration. A predictive model for mineralization potential was developed using a data-driven approach, considering critical factors such as lithology, hydrothermal alteration, lineament density, magnetic anomalies, and slope, and implemented using ArcMap 10.8. The model was trained on 70% of the Iron Ore exposure data and tested on the remaining 30%. Validation was performed using the area under curve (AUC) method, achieving an accuracy of 72%. The Iron Ore potential map generated from the model demarcated the study area into five potential zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high potential zones. The study successfully identified areas with high potential for Iron Ore mineralization, primarily structurally controlled. The developed model serves as a valuable reference and guide for future exploration and planning activities, and recommendations are made for further refinement and improvement."

    "title": "Unlocking the potential of whole-profile carbon sequestration in agricultural soils",
    "abstract": "Agricultural soils have great potential to sequester carbon, mitigating climate change while enhancing soil health. Subsoil layers are particularly promising for long-term carbon storage due to their lower carbon density and slower carbon turnover compared to topsoil. The reduced subsoil carbon density primarily results from limited carbon inputs at depth, while slower turnover is driven by 1) stronger physiochemical constraints on microbial decomposition, and 2) limited availability of high-quality, energy-rich substrates. These factors underscore the opportunities to target management practices that either increase carbon inputs to subsoil layers or reduce carbon turnover rates to enhance subsoil carbon sequestration. Advancing this field requires understanding the vertical distribution of carbon input quality and quantity, as well as the processes driven vertical carbon transport within soil profiles. Additionally, it is critical to elucidate how substrate properties (e.g., energy and nutrient content) and vertical environmental constraints (e.g., hydrothermal regimes and oxygen availability) influence microbial efficiency. Addressing these knowledge gaps will enable the design of effective management practices, unlocking the full potential of whole-profile carbon sequestration in agricultural systems."

    "title": "Impacts of physical parameterization schemes and model resolution on typhoon rainfall simulation with a variable-resolution global model",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the capabilities of a non-hydrostatic global, variable-resolution model in simulating tropical cyclone precipitation, with historically significant Typhoon Fitow (1323) as a case study. Employing three grid settings (24 km, 60-10 km, 60- 3 km) and two microphysical parameterization schemes (WSM6 and Thompson), the study investigates the influence of grid resolution and microphysical parameterization on precipitation simulation. The simulated precipitation intensity and spatial distribution of high-resolution grids exhibit better agreement with the observations compared to the coarse-resolution grids. Specifically, the 60-3 km grid setting shows the greatest improvement in spatial correlation with observed precipitation data compared to the 24 km grid. Through the analysis of the thermal dynamic field, the high-resolution grid configuration more effectively simulates indicators for strong convective weather events, such as convective available potential energy (CAPE), helicity, and nonadiabatic heating. Analysis of TRMM satellite observations reveals that the high-resolution grid simulation results more accurately capture the distribution characteristics of hydrometeor mixing ratio compared to the coarse-resolution grids. Differences in hydrometeor content within convective clouds are more pronounced across grid resolutions than in stratiform clouds, even with the same parameterization scheme. Additionally, at the same resolution, the disparity in ice-phase particle content between the two schemes is much greater than the disparity in liquid-phase particle content. It is also noteworthy that the WSM6 scheme delivers superior performance compared to the Thompson scheme. In summary, this study demonstrates that refining model resolution has a more significant impact on precipitation intensity than the selection of physical parameterization scheme. The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), using a high-resolution variable-resolution grid, can be effectively used for typhoon precipitation simulation research."

    "title": "Inorganic N fertilization reduces soil organic carbon in bamboo forests in China",
    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role in mitigating climate change. While fertilization can substantially influence SOC, its impact on SOC storage in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)-dominated forests remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 631 observations from 28 published studies to examine SOC responses to fertilization in bamboo forests dominated by AM fungi. Contrary to numerous previous meta-analyses, our results revealed that fertilization significantly decreased SOC by 4.46%. Specifically, inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizers negatively affected SOC by disrupting the soil N:P:K stoichiometric balance, which can contribute to soil degradation and potentially impair the role of AM fungi in regulating soil carbon dynamics. In contrast, organic and compound N fertilizers showed no significant effect on SOC due to external nutrient inputs and additional C offsetting these negative impacts. The effects of fertilization on SOC varied depending on the level and duration of fertilization, as well as soil depth. Low-level and long-term fertilization resulted in significant SOC losses, particularly in the subsoil. Furthermore, our correlation analysis indicated that MAP, soil pH, MBC, NH 4 + -N, and AK were key drivers of SOC responses to fertilization. Our findings offer a new perspective that contrasts with previous studies, showing that N fertilization significantly reduces SOC in bamboo forests. This underscores the need for future investigation into the mechanisms by which AM fungi regulate SOC dynamics. Consequently, we recommend using organic or compound N fertilizers to maintain SOC storage and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts."

    "title": "Application of artificial neural networks for predicting soil settlement in geotechnical applications with plastic waste reinforcement above buried pipes",
    "abstract": "The inevitability of employing shallow buried pipes in urban areas, roadways, and subways is attributed to the progress of development and population expansion. This paper investigates the impact of recycled plastic bottle utilization on soil settlement above buried pipes under static loads and employs a two-hidden-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model to accurately predict settlement values. Experimental measurements of settlement are conducted under various reinforcement conditions and applied pressures and resulted a dataset of 72 data points, which was divided into 70% for training and 30% for testing using a holdout validation approach. The results demonstrate significant reductions in settlement with plastic waste reinforcement, with mattress depth to width of the loading steel plate reinforcement ratios u/B = 0.5, u/B = 1.0, and u/B = 1.5 exhibiting settlement reductions of 0.25 mm, 2.3 mm, and 4.5 mm, respectively, compared to the unreinforced condition. The ANN model, configured with two hidden layers of 10 and 6 neurons respectively, had used the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function and trained with the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The R 2 values reached 0.9990 for training and 0.9965 for testing, while the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was maintained at 0.021% for training and 0.034% for testing which indicates minimal deviation between predicted-observed settlements. The findings highlight the practical significance of plastic bottle reinforcement as an efficient and sustainable soil improvement technique for minimizing settlement above buried pipes. Despite the high accuracy, the study acknowledges limitations related to static loading conditions, sandy SP soil type, and a relatively small experimental dataset. Future research is recommended to explore dynamic and cyclic loading scenarios, assess long-term PET degradation effects, and validate the reinforcement approach under diverse soil conditions."

    "title": "Mapping paddy rice in northeast China with a knowledge-based algorithm and time series optical, microwave, and thermal imagery",
    "abstract": "Accurate and timely large-scale paddy rice maps with remote sensing are essential for crop monitoring and management and are used for assessing its impacts on food security, water resource management, and transmission of zoonotic infectious diseases. Optical image-based paddy rice mapping studies employed the unique spectral feature during the flooding/transplanting period of paddy rice. However, the lack of high-quality observations during the flooding/transplanting stage caused by rain and clouds and spectral similarity between paddy rice and natural wetlands often introduce errors in paddy rice identification, especially in paddy rice and wetland coexistent areas. In this study, we used a knowledge-based algorithm and time series observation from optical images (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 7/8) and microwave images (Sentinel-1) to address these issues. The final 10-m paddy rice map had user’s accuracy, producer’s accuracy, F1-score, and overall accuracy of 0.91 ± 0.004, 0.74 ± 0.010, 0.82, and 0.98 ± 0.001 (± value is the standard error), respectively. Over half (62.0%) of the paddy rice pixels had a confidence level of 1 (detected by both optical images and microwave images), while 38.0% had a confidence level of 0.5 (detected by either optical images or microwave images). The estimated paddy rice area in northeast China for 2020 was 60.83 ± 0.86 × 10 3 km 2 . Provincial and municipal rice areas in our data set agreed well with other existing paddy rice data sets and the Agricultural Statistical Yearbooks. These findings indicate that knowledge-based paddy rice mapping algorithms and a combination of optical and microwave images hold great potential for timely and frequently accurate paddy rice mapping in large-scale complex landscapes."

    "abstract": "Accurate forest cover maps are the basis for estimating forest biomass and are crucial for climate regulation and biodiversity conservation, especially in sub-humid and semi-arid regions such as Oklahoma, USA. To date, there is very limited data and knowledge of the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of forest cover in Oklahoma, and current forest cover maps have large uncertainties. In this study, multi-sensor datasets, including the Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2), Landsat, and spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), were combined to generate annual forest cover maps for the years 2015 to 2021. Specifically, both PALSAR-derived HV, HH-HV, and HH/HV and Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used together to generate annual maps of forest cover and three forest types (evergreen, deciduous, and mixed forest) at 30-m spatial resolution for each year. The canopy height and canopy coverage samples from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) were used to assess forest cover maps. We also compared the spatial distribution and forested area of several forest products. Our results show that using the forest definition (canopy height > 5 m, canopy coverage > 10% over an area of 0.5 ha) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the accuracy of resultant PALSAR/Landsat forest cover map for 2019 were 77.4% (GEDI) and 95.6% (ICESat-2). The estimated forested area (51,916 km 2 ) was moderately higher (7.2%) than the forested area from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) statistics dataset (48,202 km 2 ) in 2017. Between 2016 and 2020, Oklahoma’s forested area increased slightly by 1.9%. The PALSAR/Landsat forest maps are more accurate in western Oklahoma compared to other satellite-based forest products. The resultant annual maps of forest cover and three different forest types over Oklahoma can be used to support statewide forest management and conservation."

    "abstract": "The hail size discrimination algorithm (HSDA) and its capacity to identify hail in Shandong Province are analyzed to satisfy the localized requirement by China’s S-band dual-polarization radars. A modified HSDA is obtained by using optimized membership function thresholds based on the statistics of Shandong hail data. The results are verified by a supercell storm process. 1) The modified HSDA improves the identification of large hail and giant hail. The results are consistent with the analysis of the scattering and polarization parameter characteristics of different-size hails, the dynamic and microphysical characteristics for supercell, and the real situation. 2) The horizontal and vertical hail-size distribution characteristics are consistent with the analysis about the growth process of larger hails and the precipitation particles filtering mechanisms in supercells. Small hail first forms at the suspension echo, then is injected into the larger hail growth area above the bounded weak echo area driven by updrafts, colliding with the abundant supercooled water in the K DP column. Finally, large hail and giant hail fall near the direction of the updrafts to form a strong echo wall, and giant hail falls 6–12 km from the central updraft. 3) The maxima of the Z DR and K DP columns can be used to predict the hail-growth trend, which exceeds the −20°C isotherm for the heavy-hail growth stage at high-altitude in the supercell storm. When hail falls to the ground, the Z DR column shortens and the K DP column disappears, which provides the observation basis from polarimetric radars for the consumption of supercooled water by hail growth."

    "abstract": "The characteristics and formation mechanism of clastic reservoirs have a significant impact on petroleum accumulation in the deep-seated strata of sedimentary basins. Newly drill data indicate that the tight reservoirs in the lower slop of Fukang Sag in the Junggar Basin produce a lot of oil despite being buried extremely deep and with low porosity. By using lithological and geochemical studies, we investigated the formation of these deep-seated reservoirs through the comparison between upper and lower slopes. The results suggest that the reservoir of lower slop is highly compacted and has weaker dissolution than the reservoir in the upper slope. Dissolution and micro fractures are the key factors in determining the formation of deep-seated reservoirs. The fluids that caused the dissolution of reservoir can be divided into three stages and sourced from the mixture of deep and basin fluids. A model of reservoir formation and evolution has been set up. Our research could provide an insight for the formation of deep-seated reservoirs in similar geological conditions worldwide."

    "title": "Sedimentary architecture of a sandy braided river with seasonal hydrodynamic variations: insights from the Permian Lower Shihezi Formation, Ordos Basin, China",
    "abstract": "A sandy, braided river is a typical type of river that exists in ancient and modern alluvial plains and is inherent with significant seasonal water discharge variations. The variations play an important role in the depositional process and the formation of the sedimentary architecture of braided rivers. In this paper, a braided river outcrop along the Yellow River in Fugu is used to describe the effects of seasonal hydrodynamic variations on braided river sedimentary architecture. The results show that the braided channel network exhibits two different patterns during flood period and normal period. During flood periods, the main braided channels surrounding channel bars and the secondary braided channels distributed on the top of the channel bars coexist, forming a highly braided channel network. Migration of the main braided channels control the formation of middle channel bars and side bars. The generation and evolution of the secondary braided channels reformed the upper part of preexisting channel bars and produced affiliated bars along their flow path. During the normal period, water levels decrease, causing the secondary river channels to be abandoned and forming abandoned channels, and only the main braided channels stay active. In the long term sedimentation process, strong water flow during the flood period continuously erodes pre-existing sediments and forms new sediments, while weak water flow during the normal period can only reform the main braided channels and their adjacent channel bar sediments. Based on differences in sedimentary processes and associated hydrodynamic conditions, braided river sediments are divided into two combinations. The strong hydrodynamic combination includes main braided channels, middle channel bar, and side bar, while the weak hydrodynamic combination includes secondary braided channels, abandoned channels, and affiliated bars. The proportion of strong hydrodynamic combinations is much larger than that of weak hydrodynamic combinations. Based on this, we construct a braided river sedimentary architecture model that is helpful for the fine characterization of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs."

    "title": "Discrimination of river sandbanks for sand mining in high-mineral regions using multispectral images",
    "abstract": "Sand mining is a booming industry with significant economic and environmental implications. River sandbanks serve as critical sources for sand mining. However, unregulated sand mining poses ecological risks, necessitating precise identification of potential river sandbank regions to balance economic and environmental priorities. Satellite remote sensing enables non-invasive, large-scale detection of river sandbanks through their critical mineralogical and geomorphological features. In the past, semi-supervised and supervised techniques have been used to detect mining regions including sand mining. A few techniques employ multi-modal analysis combining different modalities such as multi-spectral imaging, synthetic aperture radar ( SAR ) imaging, aerial images, and point cloud data. However, the distinguishing spectral characteristics of river sandbank regions are yet to be fully explored. Further, such techniques may face limitations in scalability and dependency on labeled datasets. This paper provides a novel method to detect river sandbank regions for sand mining using multi-spectral images without any labeled data, i.e. in unsupervised manner, over the seasons. It specifically addresses the challenge of distinguishing them from spectrally similar high-mineral regions e.g., overburden dumps. The two discriminative features of river sandbank regions can be summarized as: proximity to river channels and unique mineral composition. The proposed work uses these distinguishing features to determine the spectral signature of a river sandbank region, which is robust to other high mineral abundance regions. It follows a two-step approach, where first, potential high mineral regions are detected and next, they are segregated using the presence of a river stream. Morphological operation over a water body index is employed to detect the presence of river stream. Primarily, Landsat 8 data is used for experimentation. The proposed technique provides average accuracy, precision, and recall of \\(90.75\\%\\) , \\(85.47\\%\\) , and \\(73.5\\%\\) , respectively over the seasons from Landsat-8 images without using any labeled dataset. By eliminating dependence on annotations or multi-modal inputs, the proposed work offers a cost-effective, scalable solution to detect sandbanks in dynamic riverine environments."

    "title": "Spatial associations between electric power consumption in three major urban agglomerations of China via a len of nighttime light index",
    "abstract": "Electricity constitutes a fundamental pillar of both the national economy and contemporary lifestyles. Monitoring electric power consumption (EPC) has important implications for energy planning, energy conservation and emission reduction, energy security, and smart city development. However, the current monitoring and evaluation of EPC is less accurate and does not allow for real-time monitoring and evaluation of EPC. This study established an EPC assessment model based on EPC data, nighttime light remote sensing technology, and GIScience methodology, aiming to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of EPC in three major urban agglomerations of China from 2012 to 2020 and estimate EPC in 2025. Furthermore, the spatial correlation of EPC was explored using Moran’s I spatial analysis method. The results indicate that the established model has an average accuracy of 77.56% and can be used for accurate and real-time estimation of EPC. The EPC showed an increasing trend from 2012 to 2020, with the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD) exhibiting the highest growth rate, as high as 49.60%. The EPC in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTH) showed a negative spatial correlation. However, the YRD and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area urban agglomeration (GBA) exhibited significant positive spatial correlation in EPC. The findings of this study serve a scientific basis and reference data for the development of energy policies and strategies. Furthermore, this study can help to achieve the “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals” proposed by the Chinese government."

    "abstract": "Ecological risk is a dynamic reflection of ecosystem stability and harmonious social development. The role played by risk identification and evolutionary trend prediction as mediators between ecological risk management and prevention is complex. However, current studies have difficulty identifying where, when, and how ecological risk evolves. Here, we constructed a double evaluation index system of ecological risk source hazard and ecological risk receptor loss degree to quantitatively evaluate and simulate ecological risk in the upper Chang Jiang (Yangtze R.) (UYR). Then, we adopted the normal cloud model to identify the ecological risk level at different scales in the UYR. Finally, we leveraged set pair analysis to reveal the future evolution trend of ecological risk in the UYR. The following conclusions were drawn. 1) From 2015 to 2018, the ecological risk in the UYR exhibited significant spatial aggregation characteristics, with a spatial distribution pattern of “high in the west, low in the east”. The risk value increased from [0, 0.28] to [0, 0.32], an increase of 12.49%. 2) The ecological risk level of the UYR in 2015 and 2018 was in a high-alert state, but the risk value showed a downward annual trend. The comprehensive ecological risk value decreased from 0.5295 to 0.5135. 3) The ecological risk of 67% of the cities in the UYR will decrease in the future, and will increase in 33% of the cities. 4) The probability of geological disasters was the most significant ecological risk source in the UYR. Ecosystem service value significantly impacted ecological risk receptors loss degree in the UYR."

    "title": "Gas charging and accumulation in deep coal measures of Daning-Jixian Block, Ordos Basin: insights from fluid inclusions and basin modeling",
    "abstract": "Unconventional natural gas in deep coal measures has become an exploration and research hotspot in recent years. The exploration breakthrough of deep coalbed methane and tight sandstone gas in Daning-Jixian Block in the eastern Ordos Basin has revealed huge resource potential and commercial prospects in the deep Upper Paleozoic Carboniferous-Permian coal measures. However, the ambiguity of gas accumulation in deep coal measures has restricted exploration and development. Based on a series of tests for fluid inclusions, including petrographic observation, Raman spectroscopy analysis, and microthermometry, combined with the burial-thermal evolution history recovered from basin modeling, this study aims to clarify the timing of gas accumulation in deep coal measures. The results show four types of secondary fluid inclusions in the deep coal measure sandstone layers of Daning-Jixian Block, including CH 4 -rich inclusions, C 2+ hydrocarbons-bearing inclusions, CO 2 -bearing inclusions, and aqueous inclusions. The main formation stage of fluid inclusions corresponded to the mesodiagenesis stage of the deep coal measure sandstone, and the coeval assemblages of fluid inclusions vary due to the recording of gas charging in different maturity stages of coal measure source rocks. This study suggests that tight sandstone gas accumulation in deep coal measures was a continuous charging process with one period-multiple episodes in Daning-Jixian Block, and occurred mainly during the Early Cretaceous (137–127 Ma BP). The results of this study contribute to further understanding of gas accumulation mechanisms in deep coal measures."

    "title": "Comparative experimental investigation on pore structure and fractal characteristic of marine and continental shales",
    "abstract": "Clarifying the pore structure characteristics of shale reservoirs, which are low porosity, low permeability and high heterogeneity, is an essential prerequisite for the efficient development of shale oil and gas. Fractal theory is especially suited for characterizing the complex pore structures of shales. This work compares the pore structure characteristics between marine shales from the Longmaxi Formation and continental shales from the Shahejie Formation through low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy. Different fractal scaling models are adopted to determine the fractal dimensions and lacunarities of shales by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption data and scanning electron microscopy images. In addition, the mineral compositions from X-ray diffraction are analyzed to elucidate the mechanisms by which mineral content influences fractal dimensions. Finally, the correlations between total organic carbon content and microscopic structure are discussed. These results indicate that the pore size of marine shale is smaller than that of continental shale. Additionally, the fractal dimensions of marine shales are greater than that of continental shales, suggesting a more complex pore structure. The more quartz and clay content lead to greater complexity in pore space, resulting in higher fractal dimensions. The illite/smectite mixed layer shows a strong positive correlation with fractal dimensions for marine shales, whereas this correlation is less pronounced for continental shales. The presence of microfractures in organic matter leads to a reduction for the pore surface fractal dimension in continental shales."

    "title": "Separating the decomposition rates and temperature sensitivities of soil mineral-associated and particulate organic carbon using a data-model fusion approach",
    "abstract": "Although soil organic carbon (SOC) is a continuum of progressively decomposed compounds with diverse molecular structures, classifying SOC into particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) has been suggested to improve our understanding of SOC vulnerability to environmental changes. Incubation experiments have been extensively employed as a powerful approach to the investigation of SOC decomposition, as this method can isolate specific effects from covariations in the field. Here, we proposed a method to separate the decomposition rates and temperature sensitivities ( Q 10 ) of POC and MAOC from bulk soil incubation data using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The data used to validate our method was collected from a ∼2600 m altitudinal transect in the Eastern Himalayas. We found that reactive iron plus aluminum oxides had a significant negative effect on the decomposition rate of MAOC but had no effect on the decomposition rate of POC. The negative effect of reactive iron plus aluminum oxides on Q 10 for POC was stronger than that on Q 10 for MAOC. In addition, the relative values of Q 10 for POC and MAOC depended upon elevation, challenging the assumed higher Q 10 for POC than that for MAOC from the carbon quality temperature hypothesis. Overall, the proposed approach will improve our mechanistical understanding of soil MAOC and POC dynamics in response to environmental changes."

    "title": "Projected changes in rare extreme precipitation design values in the United States due to global warming",
    "abstract": "There is high confidence that extreme precipitation will increase in most areas if the globe continues to warm. In the US, NOAA Atlas 14 (NA14) is the most authoritative source for heavy rainfall frequency values used in infrastructure planning and design. However, NA14 assumes a stationary climate and uses only historical observations to estimate values. Thus, use of such values for design may lead to underperformance of long-lived infrastructure, thereby placing people and property at increased risk from flooding. Analyses of global climate model (GCM) simulations suggest that projected extreme precipitation changes will be positive nearly everywhere in the US and will be larger for shorter durations, lower annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs), and higher emissions. Herein, we provide adjustment factors that can be applied to observations-based precipitation frequency values to estimate potential future changes under selected global warming levels. These are derived from two statistically downscaled daily precipitation datasets (STAR and LOCA2) developed using modern methods that focus in part on modeling the high tail of the precipitation distribution with a high degree of fidelity. These datasets, each consisting of 16 ensemble members downscaled from a common set of 16 CMIP6 GCMs, provide estimates for durations of daily and longer. The set of adjustment factors are extended using seven models from the NA-CORDEX suite of dynamically downscaled simulations by analyzing the change in adjustment factors from daily to hourly durations. There is an average increase in the adjustment factors of about 1.3. This factor is applied to the daily adjustment factors from STAR and LOCA2 to produce estimates for the hourly duration."

    "title": "Geochemical characteristics of the late Eocene mudstones in the eastern Nima Basin, Xizang: implications for the paleoenvironment, provenance, and tectonic setting",
    "abstract": "Paleoenvironmental reconstruction plays a pivotal role in providing insights into the uplift history of the Xizang Plateau during the Cenozoic. The Nima Basin, situated in the central Xizang Plateau, is crucial for studying the tectonic and geomorphic evolution of this region. The clastic composition and geochemical characteristics of the Niubao Formation hold considerable potential for unravelling the geological history and reconstructing depositional environments of central Xizang in the early Cenozoic. In this study, we present detailed geochemical characteristics to determine their provenance, paleoenvironmental conditions, and tectonic origins. The index of compositional variability (ICV > 1) of mudstones indicates that low compositional maturity sediments underwent weak sedimentary recycling. The chemical index of alteration (CIA: 59.8–72.9) reveals that parental rocks experienced a moderate chemical weathering degree. The paleoclimate indicators of the mudstones suggest an oxidizing and arid depositional environment, with a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 11.64°C ± 4.19°C. The geochemical evidence also demonstrates that the mudstones were derived from mixed felsic and intermediate igneous rocks that formed in a dominantly continental island arc tectonic setting. Similarities in the geochemical characteristics among the Niubao Formation and surrounding igneous rocks indicate that a continental-scale drainage system once drained westward in central Xizang. It is concluded that the central plateau experienced a cooler and drier climate coinciding with the presence of a large-scale drainage system during the late Eocene."

    "abstract": "This study employed the three-dimensional MIKE model to simulate the hydrodynamic properties of Poyang Lake from October 2020 to December 2021. The model demonstrated high accuracy, with the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) exceeding 0.96 for water level and 0.98 for water area comparisons, indicating its efficacy in replicating the lake’s hydrodynamics. Notably, the highest pressure gradient forcing was observed in March and April, aligning with increased flow rates in the Ganjiang River, affecting the east side of Poyang Lake. This period saw a distinctive pressure gradient front in the lake’s central channel, potentially influencing material distribution. Eddy kinetic energy, calculated from model velocity data, peaked in May and June, and again in September and October, corresponding to changes in river flow rates. This energy was predominantly influenced by local dynamics in the lake’s central area, with low frequencies and extended periods, differing from other lake regions. Furthermore, the study found a strong correlation between eddy activities and the spatial distribution of water materials, as indicated by the consistency of turbidity patterns in satellite imagery and eddy kinetic energy distributions. These findings highlight the significant impact of hydrodynamic behaviors, particularly eddy movements, on the distribution of suspended materials within Poyang Lake."

    "title": "Multi-method characterization of sandstone pore size distribution heterogeneity and its influence on porosity and permeability variation",
    "abstract": "Pore volume/surface area and size distribution heterogeneity are two important parameters of pore structures, which restrict the gas-water-oil migration process in sandstone reservoirs. The fractal theory has been proved to be one of the most effective methods to quantify pore distribution heterogeneity. However, the dynamic variation of porosity and permeability due to fractal characteristics has been rarely studied. In this paper, physical properties, mineral composition, and pore distribution of 18 groups of sandstone samples were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-pressure mercury injection tests. Then, Sierpinski model, Menger model, thermodynamic model, and multi-fractal model were used to calculate the fractal dimension of the pore volume. Thus, the relationship between fractal dimension and porosity/permeability variation rate, and pore compressibility were studied. The results are as follows. 1) All samples can be divided into three types based on pore volume (0.9 cm 3 ·g −1 ) and mercury removal efficiency (35%), i.e., Type A (< 0.9 cm 3 ·g −1 and < 35%); Type B (> 0.9 cm 3 ·g −1 and <35%); Type C (> 0.9 cm 3 ·g −1 and > 35%). 2) Four fractal models had poor applicability in characterizing fractal characteristics of different sample types. The fractal dimension by the Sierpinski model had a good linear correlation with that of other models. Pores with smaller volumes dominated the overall pore distribution heterogeneity by multi-fractal dimension. The pore diameter between 200–1000 nm and larger than 1000 nm was the key pore size interval that determined the fractal characteristics. 3) With the increase of confining pressures, porosity and permeability decreased in the form of a power function. The compressibility coefficient of typical samples was 0.002–0.2 MPa −1 . The compressibility of Types A and B was significantly higher than that of Type C, indicating that the total pore volume was not the key factor affecting the pore compressibility. The correlation of compressibility coefficient/porosity variation rate with pore volume (total and different size pore volume), fractal value and mineral component were not significant. This indicates that these three factors comprehensively restricted pore compression."

    "title": "Cretaceous provenance changes in the Yishu Rift Basin, east China: implications for the uplift of East Asian coastal mountains",
    "abstract": "An early Late Cretaceous NW-SE compressional event that induced the uplift of the coastal mountains was recognized among the overall extensional regime in east China. While previous studies have explored the paleoelevation, paleogeographical extent, and possible climatic effects of coastal mountains, the exact timing of initial uplift has remained elusive. In this study, we applied detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology to sandstones from the Dasheng Group in the Yishu Rift Basin, east China. Our results suggest that the primary provenance of the Dasheng Group is intermediate-basic volcanic rocks (800–500 Ma, 330–215 Ma, and 150–122 Ma) derived from the Luxi Uplift and Sulu Orogenic Belt, and the secondary provenance is Mesoproterozoic-Paleozoic metamorphic rocks (2500–2300 Ma and 1850–1600 Ma) derived from the Jiaobei Terrane. The zircon age peaks of the Dasheng Group in the Yishu Rift Basin are nearly the same as those of the Lower Cretaceous Laiyang Group in the Jiaolai Basin. However, the proportion of pre-Mesozoic zircons decreases. For the Mesozoic zircons, although their main age peak is close to that of the Laiyang Group, their secondary age peak is similar to that of the Wangshi Group. We infer that the transitional characteristic of the Dasheng Group was caused by the initial uplift of the coastal mountains. Therefore, we speculate that the initial uplift of the coastal mountains occurred during the deposition of the Dasheng Group, and limit the maximum depositional age (MDA) of the Dasheng Group to 100–95 Ma."

    "abstract": "Based on standardized precipitation index data, a systematic analysis was conducted of the spatiotemporal variations of drought events in China from 1978 to 2018. Drought events were identified using the run theory applied to the standardized precipitation index data set, and key variables such as drought frequency, duration, and intensity were quantified. Additionally, drought vulnerability, exposure, and resilience were calculated to comprehensively assess the regional drought risk. The spatiotemporal transmission characteristics and pathways of drought risk were further explored using the Markov chain model and its extended version based on spatial lag theory. The results revealed significant differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of drought events across China, with north-west China experiencing a particularly high frequency, duration, and intensity of droughts. Overall, the pattern of drought risk presented a gradient, being higher in the north-west and lower in the south-east. The risk was relatively stable from year to year, with few large fluctuations. Moreover, a strong spatial similarity in drought risk was observed among neighboring provinces, but there was no obvious spatial lag effect. This study provides a valuable scientific foundation for effective drought disaster risk management and the formulation of response measures."

    "title": "A new parameter for characterizing pore-fracture structure heterogeneity: fractal dimension based on the mercury extrusion curve",
    "abstract": "Pressure mercury intrusion test is (MIP) one of the most commonly used methods to characterize pore-fracture structure. Here, we use the fractal dimension of the mercury intrusion curve to analyze the heterogeneity of pore and fracture distribution. Differing from the intrusive mercury curve, the extrusive curve provides a better representation of the seepage capacity of a reservoir. In this paper, the division method of sample types using both mercury invasive parameters (pore volume, pore volume percentage, porosity, permeability) and extrusive parameters (mercury removal efficiency) is discussed. The fractal dimension values of mercury intrusive and extrusive curves are calculated for all samples using the Menger, Thermodynamics, and Multifractal fractal models. Moreover, the fractal significance of the mercury withdrawal curve is examined. The results are as follows. 1) The samples can be divided into three types based on the mercury removal efficiency and total pore volume. Type A is characterized by lower total pore volume (< 0.08 cm 3 ·g −1 ) and removal efficiency (< 30%), type B has lower total pore volume (< 0.08 cm 3 ·g −1 ) and higher removal efficiency (> 30%), and type C has larger total pore volume (> 0.08 cm 3 ·g −1 ) and higher removal efficiency(> 30%). 2) Mercury removal efficiency does not correlate with the mineral composition or total pore volume, but it does show a clear positive correlation with pore volume in the range of 100 to 1000 nm. Unlike the Menger model, the mercury removal curve analyzed using the thermodynamics and multifractal model shows good fractal characteristics. 3) In contrast to the injective curves, the fractal dimension of mercury removal curves exhibits an obvious linear negative correlation with pore structure parameters and mercury removal efficiency. Moreover, the multifractal dimensions D 0 – D 10 obtained from the mercury removal curves show a negative correlation with porosity and permeability. This indicates that fractal dimension based on the mercury extrusion curve can be used as a new parameter for characterizing pore-fracture structure heterogeneity."

    "title": "Evaluation of the effectiveness of shale bedding fractures: a case study of the Longmaxi Formation in the Sichuan Basin",
    "abstract": "Bedding fractures are among the key factors affecting the production efficiency of shale oil and gas, but relatively little research has been conducted on the effectiveness of bedding fractures. Based on field outcrops and drill cores from the Fuling area in the Sichuan Basin, this work discusses the development, filling, and opening characteristics of bedding fractures and their quantitative impact on physical properties. Multiple methods were employed, e.g., immersion testing, wet illumination, high-power microscanning, imaging logging identification and experimental measurement. The results indicate that the highest density reaches 437 fractures per meter, with apertures less than 0.5µm being the majority. The average permeability of the shale samples with vertical bedding is 44.6 times that of the shale samples with parallel bedding, while the porosity exhibits less anisotropy. Many open bedding fractures with gas outlets in the core are shown by on-site immersion experiments and electron microscopy scanning experiments. Each dark stripe on the imaging logging map corresponds to a bedding fracture, and the thickness of the dark stripes corresponds to the aperture of the bedding fracture. There is no need to consider unfilled bedding fractures, as fractures filled with calcite veins and pyrite crystals can also become effective seepage channels because of the pores within the calcite veins and between the pyrite crystals. The utilization and transformation of bedding fractures during fracturing is one of the key steps in producing shale oil and gas. It is necessary to combine the in situ stress field, bedding fracture characteristics, and fracturability of shales to reasonably utilize bedding fractures to transform oil and gas reservoirs."

    "abstract": "Coastal-urban regions confront challenges stemming from the interactions between air quality and meteorological conditions. This study employed observational and reanalysis data from 2015 to 2018 to examine the sea-land breeze (SLB) characteristics in six coastal-urban regions of China. This analysis was based on two criteria: pure SLB, which excluded the background wind field (P-standard SLB), and true SLB, which incorporated the background wind field (T-standard SLB). The results showed that the frequency of SLB was higher in summer and autumn, and lower in winter and spring. Strong sea breeze (SB) days were predominantly observed in summer, whereas strong land breeze (LB) days were more common in winter. The frequency of P-standard SLB days (> 20%) was higher than that of T-standard SLB days (less than 10% at most stations). The onset time of SB was between 11:00 and 15:00 LST, while its cessation time was between 17:00 and 21:00 LST, with a duration of approximately 5–7 h. The onset time of LB was generally between 01:00 and 05:00 LST, while the cessation time was between 08:00 and 10:00 LST, with a duration of approximately 3–6 h. For every 10° increase in latitude, the onset time of P-standard (T-standard) SB was approximately 0.3 (0.7) hours earlier. The intensity and duration of both P- and T-standard SB were greater than those of LB. Overall, the SB intensity was observed to be stronger during spring and summer times, whereas the LB intensity was generally strongest in winter. Compared with the P-standard SLB, the intensity of T-standard SB (LB) was stronger (weaker). For every 5°C increase in the sealand temperature difference, the development trend of SLB increases by approximately 0.1 m/s/hr. However, under the same sea-land temperature differences, the development trend of SLB in low-latitude areas was weaker than that observed in high-latitude areas."

    "abstract": "The produced water from coalbed methane (CBM) wells contains abundant geochemical and microbiological information. The microbial communities in the produced water of 14 CBM wells from four coal-bearing synclines in Guizhou and Yunnan were successfully tested by using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing technology. The results showed that the produced water contained a large number of archaea and bacteria. The bacteria mainly included the orders Bacteroidales and Clostridiales , accounting for 37.4% and 32.92%, respectively. The water contained more than 30 species of bacteria and 15 species of methanogens. Macellibacteroids was the dominant genus, followed by the genus Citrobacter . The methanogens mainly included the orders Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinales , accounting for 57.46% and 26.49%, respectively. Methanobacterium was the dominant genus, followed by the genus Methanothrix . There were three kinds of metabolism: hydrogenotrophic methanogens, acetoclastic methanogens, and methylotrophic methanogens. The main influencing factors of archaea were coalbed properties, such as burial depth and R o,max , while the influencing factors of bacteria were mainly the physical and chemical properties of groundwater, including Cl − , total dissolved solids, and HCO 3 − . The microbial communities were segmented in the vertical direction of the coal measure strata, which can be consistent with the distribution characteristics of multiple superposed fluid systems, and the main microbial species in each section were preliminarily identified. Combining carbon and hydrogen isotopes of methane, and dissolved inorganic carbon stable carbon isotopes of produced water from CBM wells, the results showed that the microbial reduction in the Tucheng and Enhong synclines were strong and that there were obvious secondary biogases. A reduction in hydrogen-trophic methane bacteria is an important way to produce secondary biogases in the study area. These synclines are suitable to carry out microbially enhanced coalbed methane research, expanding and extending CBM stimulation technology in the later stage."

    "abstract": "Possible links between the Earth’s surface temperature and solar variability are investigated using uni- and bivariate wavelet methods, in an attempt to attribute the fluctuations of the global mean surface temperature (GMST). Time-varying strengths of oscillations on different time scales in time series for several sets of GMST and solar activity indices are evaluated using continuous wavelet transform. Furthermore, possible relationships on different time scales between the GMST and solar activity time series are investigated using cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence analyses. The results show that for the most prominent oscillations of solar activity on the ∼11-year scale, no statistically significant response is found in any of the temperature time series. Little evidence is found supporting the postulated link on the ∼60-year time scale between surface temperature and solar activity. The ∼60-year oscillations in the climate system likely stem from internal variabilities of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, especially the variabilities in the North Atlantic and the associated variabilities in the western tropical Pacific, rather than solar variability. The latitudinal differences in temperature response to solar activity depend on time scales. Our findings do not support the notion that solar variability has been playing a dominant role in recent climate change."

    "title": "Structural resilience analysis of rural networks based on complex network theory",
    "abstract": "Amidst the rapid pace of urban development, rural communities continually face the challenges posed by erratic natural disasters and human-induced disturbances. Evaluating and improving the resilience of rural areas is crucial for achieving sustainable development. Examining the rural network framework serves as a method to achieve rural resilience. This study established a contact network encompassing 13 villages in Shiba town, Mingguang City, through the collection of time-distance data, questionnaire interview data, and map vector data to examine the spatial patterns of the rural network. The examination of structural resilience was conducted through the framework of complex network theory. The examination of the network’s transitivity and diversity through the frameworks of hierarchy, matching, transitivity, and aggregation reveals its resilience to disruption simulations, such as node failure. The findings indicate that the network exhibits a configuration marked by a dense central region, sparse connections in the north, and a lack of connectivity in the south. The network exhibits a flat structure, with nodes that are relatively uniform in nature. The network exhibits significant disassortativity, classifying it as a disassortative network, where villages with higher node degrees tend to connect with those having lower node degrees. The local transitivity of the network is significantly elevated, with approximately 90% of settlements necessitating just one transfer to establish direct communication. The network exhibits significant clustering effects, marked by robust connections among villages and a few isolated node villages. The transitivity of the network and its diverse spatial patterns show markedly different characteristics when subjected to interruption simulation. The study identified two primary nodes and one susceptible node. The findings from the study precisely reflect the characteristics of the rural network. This can provide theoretical perspectives for analyzing the resilience of rural network structures and support decision-making in rural planning and development."

    "title": "Assessing the air quality, public health, and equity implications of an Advanced Clean Trucks policy for Illinois",
    "abstract": "Policies designed to reduce transportation emissions are known to be co-beneficial due to reductions in planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and health-harmful air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). The growing recognition of persistent racial and ethnic disparities in air pollution exposure and associated health impacts has increased demand for policy interventions aimed at systematically reducing such inequities. Here, we use a regulatory-grade air quality model focused on the Chicago region to find that medium- and heavy-duty vehicle (MHDV) tailpipe emissions account for ∼22% of the area’s ambient NO 2 concentrations. Exposure to MHDV-tailpipe NO 2 in our domain is associated with 1330 (95% confidence interval (CI): 330, 2000) annual premature deaths and 1580 (95% CI: −310, 3870) new cases of pediatric asthma, disproportionately affecting census tracts with higher percentages of residents of color. Given the inequitable impacts of MHDV NO 2 exposure, we also use our model to assess the air quality, health, and equity outcomes if a policy scenario based on California’s Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulation were instantaneously adopted in Illinois. We find that ACT adoption would lead to ∼48% of on-road MHDVs having zero tailpipe emissions by 2050; an instantaneous transition to this policy would reduce annual mean population-weighted NO 2 concentrations by 0.98 ppb (parts per billion) (−8.4%), resulting in reductions of 500 (95% CI: −120, −750) premature deaths and 600 (95% CI: 120, −1440) fewer new pediatric asthma cases annually–with the largest health benefits observed in neighborhoods with higher percentages of residents of color. Our study highlights the benefits of implementing policy interventions focused on zero-emission MHDVs to address air pollution exposure and health impact disparities."

    "title": "Effectiveness of nature-based solutions to reduce flooding in Quad Cities Metro Area (QCMA) using SWMM-HEC based flood model",
    "abstract": "Nature-based solutions (NbS) have gained significant attention as strategies for addressing urban environmental challenges, particularly since the establishment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. However, the current research on NbS for urban flood management lacks comprehensive methodological approaches for identifying suitable areas and evaluating their effectiveness across different urban settings. This study attempts to fill this gap by proposing a methodological framework integrating multi-criteria analysis with a SWMM-HEC-based hydrologic and hydraulic (HH) model to assess the suitability of NbS for the Quad Cities Metro Area (QCMA), consisting of Davenport, Bettendorf, Moline, and Rock Island. Eight NbS options-green roofs, rain gardens, infiltration trenches, permeable pavements, vegetative swales, dry detention basins, retention ponds, and rain barrels/cisterns - were considered based on volumetric efficiency and runoff reduction efficiency. The study reveals that implementing the proposed NbS could have substantially reduced flood depths in key historical flood events by 21% in 1993, 15% in 2008, 16% in 2011, 23% in 2014, 40% in 2019, and 10% in 2023. The findings highlight a critical trade-off between peak runoff and NbS implementation: while NbS effectively reduce flood impacts, they also enhance volumetric efficiency by approximately 43%. In high-density areas of the QCMA, flood depth reductions of around 20% suggest that NbS are a viable solution for dense urban environments with limited space. This shows the potential for integrating NbS into existing infrastructure, offering a promising approach for cities facing increasing flooding risks. The proposed methodology provides a practical framework for incorporating NbS into urban stormwater management, addressing gaps in optimizing NbS performance, and offering a pathway to scale their application in other urban areas with various environmental and social contexts."

    "abstract": "Mangrove forests are significant ecosystems worldwide and play a crucial role in maintaining the biodiversity of intertidal zones in tropical and subtropical regions. However, most mangroves have experienced large-scale losses due to anthropogenic activities and natural stress from environmental factors. Here, the dynamic changes in mangroves in the Dandou Sea (DDS) of the Beibu Gulf between 1987 and 2021 were analyzed via multispectral satellite remote sensing data from the Google Earth Engine Platform. The results indicated that the area of mangroves in the DDS increased from 225.90 ha in 1987 to 451.76 ha in 2021. Throughout this period, the overall mangrove area in the DDS, as well as in its western and central parts, underwent a rapid growth phase from 1987 to 1996, followed by a slow growth phase from 1997 to 2011, and eventually entered a stagnation phase from 2013 to 2021. Moreover, due to the biological invasion caused by Spartina alterniflora , the mangrove forests in this area tended toward fragmentation. Moreover, S. alterniflora suppressed the spread of mangrove forests, accounting for up to 41.69% of the total loss. In a similar vein, the local high-intensity economic activities within the tidal flat accounted for 32.55% of the mangrove loss. Additionally, the expansion of aquaculture ponds and construction land directly accounted for 9.45% and 7.91% of the mangrove loss, respectively. Furthermore, the establishment of mangrove nature reserves played a positive role in the restoration and expansion of mangroves in the DDS. Our results also demonstrated that sea level rise had little impact on mangrove retreat."

    "title": "Observational evidence of aerosol-warm cloud interaction over two urban locations in eastern India",
    "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interaction remains challenging due to the large uncertainties caused by the associated meteorological effects. This study examines the aerosol-warm cloud interaction over the cities of Bhubaneswar and Rourkela. A negative cloud effective radius (CER)-cloud optical depth and CER-cloud top pressure (CTP) relationship is found in all the regimes of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Bhubaneswar and Rourkela, excluding CER-CTP association in heavy pollution scenarios over Rourkela. However, a significant positive CER-cloud water path (CWP) correlation is observed in all the cases of AOD over both cities. This can be attributed to strong competition between aerosol and cloud droplets for water vapor association. CER is found to increase with AOD in all the regimes of relative humidity (RH) over both cities, excluding low and high cases of RH over Bhubaneswar. In this scenario, enhanced collision and coalescence efficiency and increased water vapor content encourage the merging of smaller droplets, resulting in the growth in effective radius of clouds. Negative pressure vertical velocity (PVV) over these cities infers that the upward movement of the air parcels helps in the growth of cloud droplets and aerosol particles besides enhancing the cloud cover. The shift from the Anti-Twomey effect to the Twomey effect has been noticed in both urban areas, with the Twomey effect being the major influence. Overall results indicated aerosol-induced heating may increase the response of turbulent heat flux (sensible heat over the land), leading to enhanced stability at the lower troposphere and subsequent suppression of vertical mixing. It results in moisture trapping near the surface and increases warm clouds in Rourkela. However, the predominance of a positive semi-direct effect over Bhubaneswar leads to an adverse relationship between warm cloud cover and aerosols."

    "title": "A new method for total organic carbon prediction of marine-continental transitional shale based on multivariate nonlinear regression",
    "abstract": "Total organic carbon (TOC) content is a crucial evaluation parameter in the process of shale gas exploration and development. Marine-continental transitional shale is characterized by strong heterogeneity and thin single-layer thickness. The discrete TOC data measured by experimental methods are unable to accurately reflect the reservoir characteristics of marine-continental transitional shale. In this paper, a multivariate nonlinear regression prediction model (R-MNR) was established, and the model was applied to predict the TOC content of shale for the first time. The ΔlgR model, multiple linear regression model (MLR), BP neural network model (BP model), and R-MNR model were built to predict the TOC of shale in Benxi Formation. The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and the number of input layer parameters (NILP) were employed to assess the efficacy of the model through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The total weight of R-MNR is 0.361, and that of BP model is 0.336. The weights of the two traditional models are 0.104 and 0.199, respectively. The results indicate that the R-MNR is comparable to the BP model in terms of prediction accuracy, and both models are significantly more accurate than the traditional prediction model. The R-MNR is capable of obtaining a clear TOC prediction formula, which is convenient for verification and promotion. During the training process of the R-MNR, the influence of each parameter and coupling relationship on the prediction results is elucidated, which enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the geophysical significance and geological process of the model. The result of this study suggests that the R-MNR can be employed to predict the TOC content of marine-continental transitional shale effectively in the future."

    "abstract": "Climate change has significantly impacted the water resources and conservation area of the Yellow River basin. The Upper Yellow River basin (UYR), referring to the area above Lanzhou station on the Yellow River is the focus of this study, the runoff changes in the UYR would greatly impact the water resources in China. Most existing studies rely on a single hydrological model (HM) to evaluate runoff changes instead of multiple models and criteria. In terms of the UYR, outputs of the previous Coupled Model International Comparison Project (CMIP) are used as drivers of HMs. In this study, the weighted results of three HMs were evaluated using multiple criteria to investigate the projected changes in discharge in the UYR using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) from CMIP6. The research’s key findings include the following. 1) Annual discharge in the UYR is expected to increase by 15.2%–64.4% at the end of the 21st century under the 7 SSPs. In the long-term (2081–2100), the summer and autumn discharge will increase by 18.9%–56.6% and 11.8%–70%, respectively. 2) The risk of flooding in the UYR is likely to increase in the three future periods (2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2081–2100) under all 7 SSPs. Furthermore, the drought risk will decrease under most scenarios in all three future periods. The verified HMs and the latest SSPs are applied in this study to provide basin-scale climate impact projections for the UYR to support water resource management."

    "abstract": "Complex hydrocarbon distributions characterize the Wenchang-A Sag. Systematic study of the geochemical characteristics of crude oil, natural gas and source rocks and their genetic relationship is still needs to be completed. The Rock-Eval, kerogen maceral, vitrinite reflectance, saturated hydrocarbon gas chromatographymass spectrometry, natural gas components, carbon isotopes, and light hydrocarbon were performed. 1) Crude oil is classified based on four factors: wax content, the presence of C 27 diasteranes, the regular steranes αα20RC 27 -αα 20RC 28 -αα20RC 29 , and the bicadinanes characteristics. Class I crude oil has high wax and C 27 diasteranes. For Class II crude oil, the regular steranes are in ‘L’- shaped distribution, and the content of bicadinanes is shallow. Class III crude oil has soft wax and C 27 diasteranes, and regular steranes in the reverse ‘L’-shaped distribution, with a high peak degree of bicadinanes. For Class IV crude oil, regular steranes are in ‘V’-shaped distribution, with high peak bicadinane. 2) Class I crude oil comes from source rocks in area C. Class II crude oil comes from source rocks in areas D and E. Class III crude oil comes from areas A, and B. Class IV crude oil comes from source rocks in area A. 3) The source of natural gas in Group I is hydro propylene, and natural gas in Group II is humic. Natural gas in Group III is mixed. Groups I and II are kerogen cracking gas, and group III is a mixture of crude oil secondary cracking gas and kerogen cracking gas. Natural gas in Groups I and II mainly come from local source rocks, and Group III has mixed source characteristics. In the future, oil exploration can continue in Areas C and D, and more favorable areas for gas exploration are Areas C, D, and E."

    "title": "An improved method for extracting cellulose from fossil wood and its paleoclimatic implications",
    "abstract": "The stable carbon isotope composition of cellulose ( δ 13 C cell ) in fossil wood is valuable for reconstructing past climatic and ecological changes, on seasonal to decadal timescales. However, extracting cellulose from fossil wood is challenging, leading to a lack of δ 13 C cell data over deep time; moreover, there is a debate about whether the stable carbon isotope composition of whole wood ( δ 13 C wood ) can reliably reflect past paleoclimatic or palaeoecological conditions. Here, we present an improved method for extracting cellulose from fossil wood. We initially used conventional methods to extract cellulose from a fossil wood sample a drill core from the Yuncheng Basin, near the Chinese Loess Plateau; however, we were unsuccessful. Subsequently, we successfully extracted cellulose and recovered 94% of the cellulose after modifying the conventional procedure. This involved increasing the reaction time during lignin removal, reducing the concentration of NaOH solution during hemicellulose removal, and employing multiple centrifugation steps for sample separation instead of a single step. We examined the relationship between δ 13 C cell and δ 13 C wood values ( n = 136), and the results revealed a positive correlation between them ( R 2 = 0.51, P < 0.001). This indicates that δ 13 C wood is a dependable proxy for qualitative paleoclimatic reconstruction. However, the apparent enrichment factor ε between δ 13 C cell and δ 13 C wood values varied between samples, highlighting the need for caution when using records of δ 13 C wood for quantitative paleoenvironmental reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Carbon and water fluxes of savannas and grasslands have large seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variation. In this study, we selected five savanna and grassland sites, each of them having 10+ years (11–21 years) of eddy covariance (EC) data, and a total of 85 site-years at these five sites which offers a unique opportunity for data analyses and model evaluation. We ran a long-term simulation (2000–2021) of the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM, v3.0) and vegetation transpiration model (VTM, v2.0) to investigate the seasonal dynamics, interannual variation, and decadal trends of modeled gross primary production (GPP VPM ) and transpiration (T VTM ) at these sites. The seasonal dynamics of daily GPP VPM and T VTM track well with the seasonal dynamics of EC-based GPP (GPP EC , R 2 : 0.76–0.93) and evapotranspiration (ET EC , R 2 : 0.69–0.92). The inter-annual variation of annual GPP VPM tracked well that of annual GPP EC , with the linear regression slopes for GPP EC versus GPP VPM-EC ranging from 0.89 to 1.11. The simulation results of GPP VPM and T VTM using two different climate data sets ( in situ climate data and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 data set (ERA5)) were similar, suggesting that ERA5 data can be used for VPM/VTM simulations at large spatial scales. From 2000 to 2021, annual GPP VPM and T VTM had no significant inter-annual trends at one savanna and three grassland sites but increased significantly at one savanna site. The results demonstrate the potential of using VPM (v3.0) and VTM (v2.0) to predict the seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variation of GPP and T in savannas and grasslands."

In this study, we investigated the ages of Xiuyan impact crater lake sediments from a 99-m composite borehole using luminescence and radiocarbon dating. The results showed that all the radiocarbon ages were saturated and that the surface sediments in the crater lake were dated to ∼331–334 ka. Furthermore, the luminescence ages of lake sediments at depths below approximately 37 m also appear to be saturated. The evolutionary history of the Xiuyan impact crater lake was reconstructed by incorporating sedimentological, geomorphological, and geochronological analyses. Based on the age-depth model results of luminescence ages above a depth of 37 m, it is suggested that the crater lake underwent several stages: initial formation at approximately 1201 ± 133 ka, subsequent filling with water and sediment, overflow, and eventual disappearance at ∼331–334 ka."

    "abstract": "China is one of the countries with the most diverse natural disasters in the world, and the rapidly increasing demand for disaster risk protection for rice, wheat, and maize underscores the necessity of developing robust agricultural insurance to ensure food security. Based on county level disaster loss data for floods, droughts, and typhoons and planting area data for rice, wheat, and maize from 2015 to 2021, in this paper, a quantitative model for insurance premium rates is established and the insurance premium rates for rice, wheat, and maize in each county of China are determined. The main conclusions are as follows. 1) In rice producing regions, there are 118 counties with high rates, mainly concentrated in the eastern and south-western part of Hubei, central-northern part of Hunan, north-western part of Guizhou, and northern part of Jiangsu. Examples of areas with relatively high rates include the Zengdu District, Dawu County, and Jiangxia District in Hubei, with rates of 0.200, 0.198, and 0.196, respectively. 2) There are 54 counties with high rates in wheat producing regions, mainly concentrated in the central and north-western regions, including Suixian County and Laifeng County in Hubei and the Langya District in Anhui, with rates of 0.448, 0.412, and 0.428, respectively. 3) The counties with high rates for maize producing regions are mainly concentrated in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, central and northern part of Shanxi, and southern part of Liaoning. Lintao County and the Pingchuan District in Gansu and Lanling County in Shandong having rates of 0.200, 0.190, and 0.197, respectively. The results reveal the occurrence of regional differences in agricultural insurance rates for rice, wheat, and maize in China, further enhancing the accuracy of insurance rates and providing a reference for the implementation of differentiated rates across regions nationwide. Our method has significance for further improving the framework and model of crop disaster risk management and disaster reduction work."

    "abstract": "The hydrogen isotope composition of leaf wax n -alkanes ( δ 2 H alk ) has been used to reconstruct hydroclimate conditions, yet the factors that influence it are not fully understood, particularly the control of soil pore water δ 2 H. This study monitored the temporal and vertical variations of peat pore water δ 2 H ( δ 2 H pw ) from 2015 to 2019 in the Dajiuhu peatland, central China. Results showed that δ 2 H pw was highly variable in the surface layers (0–10 cm; avg. −47 ‰, 1 σ = 11 ‰) and remained almost constant in deeper depths (below 50 cm; avg. −56 ‰, 1 σ = 2 ‰). The δ 2 H pw of the 0–10 cm layer was strongly correlated with the preceding month’s precipitation δ 2 H ( δ 2 H p ) in the adjacent area ( r = 0.7, p < 0.01), indicating that δ 2 H p is the main factor affecting the temporal variations of δ 2 H pw in the upper layers. Moreover, the surface (0–10 cm) peat pore water slightly deviated from the local meteoric water line, suggesting that evaporation may also have an effect on the δ 2 H pw . These findings emphasize the importance of precipitation isotope composition in interpreting the δ 2 H alk in peat deposits under subtropical climates."

    "title": "Formation process of extremely thick coal seams in terrestrial basin: a case study from Saishiteng Coalfield, northern Qaidam Basin, China",
    "abstract": "Sequence stratigraphy and coal petrology can be used to comprehensively analyze the mechanism of extremely thick coal seams under the influence of the paleo-climate, paleo-environment, and accommodation space during a coal-forming period. Based on the vertical variations in coal quality, macerals, and lithology, key sequence surfaces were identified, including the terrestrialization surface (TeS), paludification surface (PaS), give-up transgressive surface (GUTS), accommodation reversal surface (ARS), exposure surface (ExS), and flooding surface (FS) in thick coal seams of the Middle Jurassic Dameigou Formation in the Saishiteng Coalfield, northern Qaidam Basin. Using these key sequence surfaces, thick terrestrial coal seams can be divided into several wetting-up and drying-up cycles. In general, the vitrinite content, vitrinite/inertinite ratio (V/I), and gelification index (GI) increased from bottom to top, whereas the inertinite content decreased in the wetting-up cycles. The vertical stacking pattern considers the PaS as the bottom boundary, and the GUTS or ARS as the top boundary, representing an increasing trend in the accommodation space. However, the vitrinite content, V/I, and GI values decreased from the bottom to the top, whereas the inertinite content increased during the drying-up cycle. Another vertical stacking pattern started from the TeS, with the ExS or ARS as the top boundary, representing a decreasing trend in the accommodation space. The thick coal seams at the edge of the Saishiteng Coalfield are blocked by a large number of clastic sediments, whereas relatively few clastic sediments are found in the coalfield center; thus, a single extremely thick coal seam with good continuity can be formed. Based on the coal petrology and sequence stratigraphic analyses, a model of extremely thick coal seams superimposed on multiple peatlands was established from the basin margin to the basin center. Four to five drying-up and wetting-up cycles were predicted in accumulation variation. During a water transgression stage, new peat accumulates on the land, corresponding to a wetting-up cycle. In a water regression stage, new peat accumulates in the basin center, corresponding to a drying-up cycle. Analysis of the genesis of thick coal seams is important for the in-depth excavation of geological information during the coal-forming period and for coal resource exploration in terrestrial basins."

    "title": "River patterns transition of subaqueous distributary channels in delta front and its significances for petroleum geology: an insight from Paleogene Yabus Formation in the Sag A of Melut Basin, South Sudan",
    "abstract": "Subaqueous distributary channel sandbodies within delta fronts are crucial reservoirs in continental petroliferous basins. Understanding the spatiotemporal transition of river patterns in these channels is essential for accurate evaluation and prediction of oil and gas reservoirs, as well as for providing direct evidence of basin evolution. In the Yabus Formation of the Sag A of Melut Basin, a comprehensive analysis involving sequence division, sedimentary characteristics, seismic facies, highresolution reservoir inversion, and sand body distribution revealed significant insights. During the Yabus Formation deposition, three intermediate base-level cycles were identified, each showing transition phenomena in the river patterns of subaqueous distributary channels within the delta front. Clear identification criteria for different river patterns were established. Braided subaqueous distributary channels exhibited dominant vertical accretion, high sand content, significant sandstone thickness, and continuous-strong amplitude seismic reflections. While the braided-meandering transition pattern showed a combination of vertical and lateral accretion, medium sand content, moderate sandstone thickness, and medium continuous-medium strong amplitude seismic reflections. Meandering subaqueous distributary channels were characterized by lateral accretion, low sand content, minimal sandstone thickness, weak continuous-weak amplitude seismic reflections, and mud-rich inversion features. The primary control factor influencing the transition of river patterns in these channels was identified as the long-term base-level cycle, shaped by paleotopography and sediment supply. Braided subaqueous distributary channels emerged as the main exploration interval for structural prospects, serving as lateral high-speed migration pathways. Dendritic braided and meandering transition intervals were deemed favorable for both structure-lithologic prospects and the expansion of new exploration fields and layers."

    "title": "Nested MPI-CWRF dynamical downscaling and future projections of summer extreme precipitation changes in China",
    "abstract": "This study develops a nested MPI-CWRF dynamical downscaling system by using the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting Model (CWRF, ∼30 km) driven by the MPI-ESM1-2-HR global climate model (GCM, ∼100 km), aiming to improve the future projections of summer extreme precipitation over China. This system is implemented for both present climate simulations (1980–2014) and future projections (2016–2050) under the highest emission scenario of SSP5-8.5. Comparative analyses with high-resolution MPI-ESM1-2-XR (∼50 km) demonstrate that dynamical downscaling achieves superior improvements in simulating summer precipitation extremes than mere GCM resolution enhancement. Future projections indicate divergent trends and interannual variability across eastern China: summer precipitation averages (PRA), daily precipitation extremes (P95), and intensity of persistent precipitation events (Rx5day) are projected to have greater increases and enhanced interannual variability under MPI-CWRF compared to GCM, while the number of rainy days (NRD) is projected to decline with reduced interannual variability in south-eastern regions. Specifically, Central China exemplifies this pattern with NRD decreasing by 4.0%, but PRA, P95, and Rx5day increasing by 4.9%, 8.9%, and 11.8%, respectively. These projected changes correlate with key atmospheric shifts: the south-eastward expansion of the South Asian High, the southward-displaced East Asian jet, and anomalous low-level cyclonic circulations over the Yellow-Bohai Seas, as well as strengthened moisture convergence and convective available potential energy through intensified southerly monsoon flows. The physical coherence among these key circulation changes ensures the reliability of extreme precipitation projections made by the MPI-CWRF dynamical downscaling system."

    "title": "Evaluation of carbon storage in a metropolitan area based on long-term time series of Land Use/Cover Change dynamics",
    "abstract": "This research focuses on analyzing land use and cover changes in Metropolitan Area of Wuhan between 1988 and 2023, utilizing a comprehensive data set from Landsat remote sensing and machine learning techniques to understand their implications for carbon storage. It finds that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm outperforms others like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), and Classification and Regression Trees in identifying land use types, achieving high accuracy and a Kappa coefficient exceeding 0.98. Significant changes in Wuhan’s landscape have been noted, especially the marked decrease in arable land and increase in urban construction, reflecting the pressures of economic development and urban expansion on natural resources and their impact on the ecosystem. The study uses the InVEST model to assess how these land use transformations affect carbon storage, revealing a significant decrease in carbon storage from 1988 to 2023, with a total reduction of approximately 428.59 × 10 4 t from 1988 to 2023, largely attributed to the conversion of key carbon sequestering lands such as arable lands and forests into urban areas. This transition, particularly from arable land to urban construction land, underscores the challenges faced in managing land use changes without compromising environmental sustainability and carbon storage capacities."

    "title": "Residential land growth simulation of agent-based model by coupling big data and reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "Urban expansion has far-reaching implications for economy, environment, and socio-cultural aspects of a city. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the complex dynamics and driving factors behind urban expansion in order to make informed decisions that promote the long-term sustainability of a city. Currently, cellular automata (CA) and agent-based modeling (ABM) have been widely employed to simulate urban land growth. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive consideration of the influence of individual agent attributes and land population capacity on site selection decisions. Consequently, we propose a novel approach that incorporates fine-scale population data into the site-selection decision simulation process, allowing for a granular depiction of individual decision attributes. Moreover, the site selection process integrates assessment criteria, including population capacity and neighborhood development status. Furthermore, to address the issue of fragmented simulated residential land use outcomes, population redistribution is iteratively conducted. Additionally, by integrating extended reinforcement learning mechanisms, the site selection process of residential multi-agent systems experiences a significant improvement in overall simulation accuracy. The proposed model was applied to simulate urban expansion in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China. The results demonstrated that this model effectively enhances the behavioral decision-making capabilities of intelligent agents, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms underlying urban expansion. These findings hold considerable significance for making informed urban planning decisions and advancing the goal of sustainable urban development."

    "title": "Coming to understand sustainable energy using guided self-directed learning",
    "abstract": "Contemporary engineering education faces evolving challenges due to shifting professional, social, and student demands. While traditional knowledge transfer methods persist, there is growing recognition among leaders in engineering education of the inadequacy of passive learning approaches for addressing complex, multidimensional problems. Moreover, the imperative to cultivate sustainability capabilities among engineering students necessitates a departure from conventional pedagogies toward more innovative and inclusive educational practices. This study explores the efficacy of guided self-directed learning (GSDL) methods in promoting both cognitive and emotional engagement among undergraduate engineering students, while focusing on sustainable energy education. Over four semesters (Fall 2019, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Spring 2022), a total of 609 students ( N = 609) enrolled in a sophomore-level thermodynamics course were introduced to guided self-directed assignments and active learning strategies, delivered through in-person (2019, 2022), synchronous online (2020), and hybrid (2021) modes of instruction. These approaches aimed to enhance problem-solving skills while fostering both cognitive and emotional connections to sustainability issues. Of these students, 351 ( n = 351) actively participated in the study. By integrating these strategies, the course promoted deeper engagement with the material and its real-world applications, encouraging students to explore and strengthen their understanding of sustainability concepts, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of fostering collaborative interdisciplinary learning communities and incorporating an understanding of new technologies into various learning environments. While challenges such as student anxiety and varying levels of interest remain, the adoption of GSDL approaches holds promise for encouraging future engineers to think more creatively, critically, and independently while also developing greater empathy. Student evaluations of the course support these “think-feel-do” methods. Guided Self-Directed Learning also presents itself as a potential foundation for developing solutions to sustainability challenges. We propose that the transformative educational practices we probe in this paper can help inspire students to transcend traditional paradigms and catalyze positive shifts toward a more sustainable future."

These samples were placed in a field for a physical weathering and dust deposition experiment. In the natural Gobi Desert environment, the dust-sized fractions (< 0.063 mm in diameter) produced by physical weathering and via dust deposition in the above groups were 1387 ± 124, 702 ± 70, 698 ± 47, 742 ± 101, and 769 ± 75 gm −2 , respectively, from 18 October 2020 to 18 December 2021.

For the same respective groups, 5.32 ± 0.76%, 0.58 ± 0.27%, 0.53 ± 0.18%, 0.80 ± 0.52%, and 0.98 ± 0.31% (by weight) of the bulk samples were weathered into dust-sized fractions during the experimental period. The physical weathering intensities were 23.95%, 14.96%, 8.90%, and 2.81% by weight for fraction groups of 2–4, 4–8, 8–16, and > 16 mm, respectively. The fine-grained materials of the gravel were more sensitive to physical weathering than coarse materials. In natural environments, the processes of dust deposition and physical weathering were key factors affecting the surface topographical equilibrium of the Gobi Desert and dust emission in Asia."

    "title": "Seismic vulnerability and risk assessment using multimodal data and machine learning: a case study of the central urban area of Jinan City, China",
    "abstract": "Seismic hazards pose a major threat to life safety, social development, and the economy. Traditional seismic vulnerability and risk assessments, such as field survey methods, may not be suitable for densely built-up urban areas due to the limited availability of comprehensive data and potential subjectivity in judgment. To overcome these limitations, an integrated method for seismic vulnerability and risk assessment based on multimodal remote sensing data, support vector machine (SVM) and GIScience methods was proposed and applied to the central urban area of Jinan City, Shandong Province, China. First, an area with representative buildings was selected for field survey research, and an attribute information base established. Then, the SVM method was used to establish the susceptibility proxies, which were applied to the whole study area after accuracy evaluation. Finally, the spatial distribution of seismic vulnerability and risk under different seismic intensity scenarios (from VI to X) was analyzed in GIScience. The results show that the average building vulnerability index in the central urban area of Jinan City is 0.53, indicating that the overall seismic performance of buildings is at a moderate level. Under the seismic intensity scenario of VIII, the buildings in the Starting area and New urban district of Jinan would mostly suffer ‘Moderate’ damage, while Old urban areas, with more seismic-resistant buildings, would experience only ‘Slight’ damage. This study aims to offer an efficient and accurate method for assessing seismic vulnerability in mid to large-sized cities characterized by concentrated population densities and rapid urbanization, as well as provide a valuable reference for efforts in urban renewal, seismic mitigation, and land planning, particularly in cities and regions of developing countries. Additionally, it contributes to the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 11, which seeks to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."

    "abstract": "Sea level change impact predictions on coastal environments are fraught with uncertainties especially in the absence of ecosystem-specific response patterns to a natural surrogate. Time-dependent variation in tidal forcing is an ideal surrogate to employ for comparative assessments. Results of simultaneous quarter-hourly monitoring of Calabar River and contiguous Anantigha groundwater levels within the mesotidal coast of S. E. Nigeria are presented for sequential low- and high-stand phases of 33 half-fortnightly tidal cycles. While their semi-diurnal tidal cycle water level curves show broad similarities, their curve shape characteristics convey statistically-contrasting dynamics. The river water level was rise rate-asymmetric (82%) at high-stand phase with no-asymmetry at low-stand phase. By contrast, groundwater consistently showed fall rate-asymmetry. The flood/ebb duration ratios showed the river as ebb-asymmetric (79%) at high-stand phase with no-asymmetry at low-stand counterpart. The groundwater consistently indicated > 90% flood-duration asymmetry. The rise and fall rates of both water levels showed positive correlation with oscillation amplitude, the strongest being at low-stand phase for groundwater (r = 0.74 to 0.82). The relationship between the rise/fall rate ratio and flood/ebb duration ratio for both water bodies was characterized by strong inverse correlation (r = -0.95 to -0.99). Compared with the river, groundwater levels depicted about 2-fold lower %-deviation from its mean, 9-fold higher frequency of negative kurtosis (≥ -1.5) and more consistent symmetric (-0.3 to 0.3 range) distribution. The observed disparities suggest that sea level change impact prediction on coastal regions must be integrative of constituting ecosystems."

    "abstract": "The oblique subduction of the Indian Plate beneath the Sunda Plate has resulted in the formation of diverse morphotectonic structures and major changes to the seafloor topography in the Andaman Sea, northeastern Indian Ocean. Inner volcanic arc, sliver fault system, narrow oceanic basins and backarc basins are the principal morphotectonic elements that influenced the tectonic setting and geodynamics of the Andaman backarc region. The volcanoes and fault systems in Myanmar and Sumatra are well studied, but we know relatively less about the morphotectonics of the submarine volcanoes and sliver fault networks in the Andaman Sea, that connect the volcanoes and fault systems in Myanmar and Sumatra. In the present study, we compiled the all-available high resolution bathymetry data which covers an area of approximately 140,000 km 2 in the Andaman backarc region and provided a detailed morphotectonic analysis of each of the tectonic elements. The data show 33 submarine volcanoes of varying dimension in the Andaman Sea, that stretches from the dormant Narcondam volcano to the north of Sumatra Island. In addition, the major fault systems such as Great Sumatra Fault, West Andaman Fault and Andaman Nicobar Fault that starts from northern Sumatra and ends with Andaman Backarc Spreading Centre delineated from the high-resolution bathymetry data are analysed. Northward extension of the Great Sumatra Fault furcates into several branches, which produce narrow oceanic basins. The existence of submarine volcanoes situated in the middle of these basins indicate that the Andaman-Nicobar-Sumatra volcanic arc traverses through this narrow basinal area. The occurrence of well-developed cratered volcanoes, frequent earthquake swarms and gas emanations through the flanks of the cratered seamount suggest that the off Nicobar region between 6ºN to 8ºN is the most active part of the volcanic arc during the recent past."

    "abstract": "Qinshui Basin possesses enormous deep coalbed methane (CBM) resources. Fine and quantitative description of coal reservoirs is critical for achieving efficient exploration and development of deep CBM. This study proposes a 3D geological modeling workflow that integrates three parts: geological data analysis, 3D geological modeling, and application of the model, which can accurately predict the favorable areas of CBM. Taking the Yushe-Wuxiang Block within the Qinshui Basin as a case study, lithology identification, sequence stratigraphy division, structural interpretation is conducted by integrating well logging, seismic, and drilling data. Six lithology types and regional structural characteristics of the Carboniferous-Permian coal-bearing strata are finely identified. Combining experimental testing on porosity and gas content and well testing on permeability, a 3D geological model that integrates the structural model, facies model, and property model was established. Utilizing this model, the total CBM resource volume in the study area was calculated to be 2481.3 × 10 8 m 3 . Furthermore, the model is applied to predict the distribution ranges of four types of CBM favorable areas. The workflow is helpful to optimize well deployment and improve CBM resource evaluation, ultimately provide theoretical guidance for subsequent efficient exploration and development. Our study constitutes a reference case for assessing potential of CBM in other blocks due to the successful integration of multiple available of data and its practical applications."

    "title": "Shallow-to-mesophotic geomorphic habitats influenced by a drowned incised valley in the Western Equatorial Atlantic",
    "abstract": "Inherited topographies on drowned shelves post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) play a key role in sedimentary processes because submerged landforms create specific geomorphic habitats. This study aims to analyze the sedimentary patterns related to shallow (< 30 m) and mesophotic (30–40 m) habitats, focusing on the geomorphic changes of the Coreaú incised valley in northeastern Brazil. The analysis is based on bathymetric, side-scan sonar, satellite images, remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and sedimentological data. Additionally, we correlate the influence of post-LGM shelf flooding with global sea-level variation curves. The Coreaú incised valley exhibits inherited morphologies categorized into three main geomorphic habitats: channelized features (incisions, walls, and troughs), paleointerfluves, and margins. Consequently, the identified sedimentary patterns are distributed in response to these geomorphic habitats. Carbonate sedimentation is predominant, characterized by poorly sorted deposits mainly composed of sand and mud fractions. Major grain components include mollusks, foraminifera, calcareous algae, and quartz. The deepest geomorphic habitats (e.g., troughs) contain higher concentrations of mud, iron element, organic matter, and molluscan grains, following the channelized morphology (axis of the valley bottom). In contrast, the valley margins exhibit coarser sediment (e.g., gravel), higher calcium content, lower organic matter, and a greater presence of calcareous algae. An increase in CaCO 3 content basinward was also observed. Bedform patterns identified through side-scan sonar data highlight the presence of dunes and ripples in the shallowest geomorphic habitats (e.g., paleointerfluves and margins) while plane beds associated with fine sediments were found in the troughs. Additionally, the abundant muddy carbonate sediments along the channelized valley floor (habitat rich in mollusks) appears to be influenced by seasonal along-shelf suspension transport on this siliciclastic-poor shelf. Thus, the control exerted by submerged fluvial landforms on the establishment of shallow-to-mesophotic habitats in response to shelf drowning during marine isotope stage (MIS) 1 is evident, particularly after Meltwater Pulse 1C (MWP-1C)."

    "title": "A three-weight surface modeling approach for optimizing small-scale population disaggregation",
    "abstract": "In recent years, fine-scale gridded population data has been widely adopted for assessing and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the existing population disaggregation techniques struggle to generate precise population grids for small areas with scarce data. To address this, we have introduced a novel, lightweight population gridding technique that integrates dasymetric mapping and point-based surface modeling, titled three-weight surface modeling. This method comprises three weights, each offering a unique perspective on population spatial heterogeneity. The first weight, termed building-volume weight, is equivalent to the preliminary results of assigning population based on building volume data. The second weight, termed POI-center weight, comprises POI (Point of Interest) categories and aggregation patterns, aiming to articulate high-density population centers. It is computed using the neighborhood accumulation rule of Spearman’s correlation coefficients between POIs and population size. The third weight, termed POI-distance weight, represents varying decay rates of population with distance from high-density centers. This three-weight surface model facilitates dynamic adjustment of parameters to refine the building-volume weight according to the remaining POI-related weights, thereby generating a more precise population surface. Our analysis of the census population and the disaggregation outcomes from 544 villages in three counties of southern Guizhou Province, China (namely, Huishui, Luodian, and Pingtang) revealed that the three-weight surface model using local parameter groups outperformed individual dasymetric mapping or point-based surface modeling in terms of accuracy. Also, the 10 m population grid generated by this local parameter model (LPTW-POP) presented greater resolution and fewer errors (RMSE of 1109, MAE of 422, and MRE of 0.2630) compared to commonly use gridded population datasets like LandScan, WorldPop, and GHS-POP."

    "abstract": "Methane released from shelf regions is considered to be an important contributor to climate change. Knowledge of potential emissions from specific regions is therefore critical for estimating expected climate change. To this end, we use multichannel seismic data acquired in 2011 to image the subsurface and identify upwelling gas migration structures along the outer Chukchi Shelf in the Arctic Ocean. We examine the upper 2500 ms TWT of sediments for distinct sedimentary structures and anomalous seismic velocities. The data show a wide distribution of bright spots as a consequence of the fluid migration from deeper sources throughout the study area. However, no bottom simulating reflector is identified in the study area to indicate the base of a likely gas hydrate zone. Furthermore, high seismic velocities and strong ground reflectors are not observed, suggesting an absence of submarine permafrost from the outer Chukchi Shelf."

    "abstract": "One of the most applied models for the characterization of sandy beaches is the Wright and Short (Morphodynamic variability of surf zones and beaches: A synthesis) Beach State Model (BSM) that empirically relates dissipative, intermediate and reflective beach types to wave conditions and sediment characteristics. Here we utilize the Delft3D-4 modelling system and create an idealized morphodynamics model to explain beach morphological changes under varying wave conditions. The model accounts for the 3D hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes and is capable of simulating both erosive upstate and accretive downstate sequences. Under an energetic condition, the profile develops into an alongshore-uniform dissipative two-bar profile. Under low wave-energy condition, the morphology develops downstate, leading to initiation and evolution of rip currents following onshore movement of the bar. The bar-formation process starts with sediment erosion at the point with maximum suspended load transport by undertow and sediment deposition on the offshore side of the breakpoint. Later, the sandbar develops as a result of sediment transport convergence of wave asymmetry and the undertow and moves offshore."

    "title": "Sedimentary evolution of the Holocene mud belt in the East China Sea: evidence from spatial and temporal variations in accumulation rates and clay mineral composition",
    "abstract": "Marine sedimentary records are commonly used to reconstruct historical environmental changes. During the Holocene, a mega mud belt developed in the East China Sea. This study investigates the sedimentary evolution of this mega mud belt by conducting a comprehensive analysis of accumulation rates and clay mineral composition from multiple sediment cores. Analysis of accumulation rates identifies four distinct depositional units (DUs): DU 1 (10–5 ka), DU 2 (5–3 ka), DU 3 (3–0.6 ka), and DU 4 (0.6–0 ka). Examination of clay mineral composition indicates that the Changjiang River is the primary sediment source, with notable contributions from the Yellow River. Based on these findings, a sedimentary model that relates the four DUs to the two main sediment sources is proposed. During the DU 1 period, shallow marine environments were predominant, characterized by low accumulation rates (generally below 4 m/ka) due to the distance from the Changjiang Estuary. In the subsequent DU 2 period, shallow marine conditions persisted, but sediment starvation occurred as a result of cold and dry climatic conditions. The DU 3 period marked a transition to prodelta environments, characterized by substantial accumulation rates (typically ranging from 4 to 8 m/ka). In the recent DU 4 period, abundant sediment supplies from the Changjiang Delta and the Yellow River led to rapid accumulation rates, commonly ranging from 4 to 16 m/ka. Overall, the East Asian monsoon plays a critical role in influencing various factors, including river discharge, delta expansion, and the alongshore dispersal of sediments."

    "abstract": "The Qizhou Island sea area is located northeast of Hainan Island and is characterized by extensive and steep narrow continental shelves to the northeast and southwest, respectively, it is connected to the Qiongzhou Strait to the west. Its unique geographical location is important for investigating sediment distribution and transport patterns. The present study analyzed the grain size characteristics of 80 surface sediment samples from the Qizhou Island sea area, revealing that the northwest section is predominantly composed of clay, whereas the southeast section is primarily sandy. End-member modeling of grain size identified four distinct components: EM1 represents the offshore transport of terrestrial materials from the northwest, EM2 indicates material input from the southwest, EM3 reflects material input from the northeast, and EM4 may signify residual sediments from a previous low sea level period. Grain size trend analysis revealed that the northeastern area mainly receives material input from the northeast, while the southwestern region is dominated by input from the southwest. Numerical simulation experiments demonstrated that the predominant current direction in the study area is from northeast to southwest. The sedimentation model illustrated that sediment thickness decreases from the northeast to the southwest annually, aligning with material input from the northeast. However, sediment thickness in the southern region is greater between September and November, attributed to a shift in current direction to southwest-northeast during the summer monsoon, which transports substantial riverine sediments generated by summer monsoon and typhoon rainfall from Hainan Island into the study area. The bi-directional sediment transport in this region is driven by seasonal currents influenced by the East Asian monsoon and is further affected by river systems in Southern China and smaller mountainous rivers on Hainan Island. Further investigation involving additional indicators in this area is anticipated to enhance our comprehension of the source-sink system under the combined influence of major rivers and small mountainous rivers globally."

    "abstract": "We analyzed multibeam echosounder (MBES), 2D and 3D compressed high-intensity radar pulse sub-bottom profile (Chirp SBP) data, and piston core samples to investigate seafloor undulations and their distribution, depositional processes, and timing in the uppermost Korea Strait Shelf Mud (KSSM) deposits on the southeastern continental shelf of the Korean Peninsula. The seafloor undulations align with the bathymetric contours, trending from NNE to SSW offshore Ulsan, Korea. These undulations extend approximately 30 km in length and 600 to 1,100 m in width at water depths of 46–56 m in the KSSM depositional area. We observed elongated ridges (100–200 m in width and 1.5–2.5 m in height, and > 300 m in length) in shallower areas and gently eroded seafloors in deeper areas. Analysis of a piston core sample, collected from a ridge slope at a water depth of 51.2 m, indicates rapid deposition of reworked sediments around 183 calendar years before present (cal yr BP). The formation of these depositional features is likely influenced by the southwest-flowing Korea Strait Bottom Cold Water (KSBCW), which intrudes from the Ulleung Basin in the East Sea. This suggest that the seafloor undulations, including high elongated ridges and eroded lowlands, were shaped by shallow-water bottom currents on the southeastern muddy continental shelf offshore Ulsan, Korea. Our data further indicate that upward gas migration is confined to the undulating seafloor morphology highlighting the significance of bottom water currents in gas migration dynamics and the shaping of seafloor morphology in the southeastern shelf of the Korean Peninsula."

To understand and estimate resource distribution, a detailed high-resolution seabed survey using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) was conducted in the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) at a depth of ~ 5270 m. High-resolution geophysical datasets such as multibeam survey, HISAS backscatter and 4 K resolution photographic results revealed detailed morphological and nodule characteristics of the study area. The polymetallic nodule coverage was assessed based on the result of camera image analysis of approximately 130 line kilometers from 1200 grids spaced at 20 m within the 0.5 km² study area. Surface nodule coverage varied throughout the study area, reaching a maximum of 4.57%, predominantly in the southwest region. The distribution of nodules is uneven, with few to no nodules found in the valleys, and the majority located on the flanks of hills. It is found that the topography and morphology on the small scale have a large effect on the nodule distribution by favoring high nodule coverage in the gently sloped regions than the undulated areas. This study revealed even small reliefs in the topography of < 10 m vertically < 0.5 m influencing the nodule distribution. Most of the observed areas with high nodule coverage have slopes of less than 3 degrees, in the perspective of mining machine maneuverability. This paper presents the results of high-resolution seafloor information to determine the correlation between seafloor morphology and nodule distribution and the factors affecting the distribution."

    "abstract": "On November 1, 1755, Europe witnessed one of the most devastating natural disasters: a violent earthquake triggered a tsunami that affected large areas of the Atlantic coast. This study analyses the deposits associated with the 1755 tsunami in Conil de la Frontera, combining sedimentary, historical, and taphonomic evidence. The results show that the grain size and the presence of bioclasts confirm a marine and highly energetic origin of the sediments. Historical documents indicate that the first wave reached 8–10 m in height. Furthermore, the analysis of fossil remains found in the area, whose ages were established by stratigraphic correlation, suggests that they correspond to the Lisbon seismic event."

    "title": "Holocene relative sea-level history and incised-valley fill stratigraphy of the Nakdong River Lowland, South-East Korea",
    "abstract": "The Nakdong River, a major river on the Korean Peninsula, has been the focus of numerous studies over the last several decades. This study compiled sedimentary facies and age data from both published and new cores from the post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) incised valley fill deposits beneath the coastal plain in the Nakdong River Valley (NRV). The presence of a fluvial system led to a deep incision during the LGM, and the post-LGM sediment succession provides a well-preserved geological record. Five new sediment cores were collected from the NRV coastal plain, along with data from 12 published cores. The new data from five cores were combined with published data from 12 cores to define cross-sections through the NRV and construct isochrones. We also constructed the Holocene relative sea level (RSL) change in the NRV by analyzing intertidal and supratidal sediments. In total, 303 age dates, including 70 new dates, were reviewed, and 220 depositional ages were selected to create a RSL curve. We identified initial marine flooding due to the last deglacial transgression and shoreline progradation during the Holocene highstand. Using age-depth plots of 49 selected sea level index points (SLIPs), a sea level curve was plotted and corrected using modern tidal range data. The age of the Holocene incised-valley fill stratigraphy and relative sea-level indicators in the NRV spans approximately 13–1 ka. At the study site, which has a mean spring tidal range of 1.2 m, supratidal and intertidal sediments accumulated according to the fluctuation of RSL. This RSL curve showed that the sea level rose at an average rate of 10.4 mm/yr from 12.2 to 8.2 ka. During this period, it rose rapidly from − 55 m to − 15 m, in several stages of stepwise stages. From 8.2 to 4.5 ka, the rate of increase slowed to an average of 2.8 mm/yr, placing it at about − 3 m below the current level. Around 3 ka, it dropped by 1.5 m to − 4.5 m. The sea level has risen gradually to the present level since 3 ka. This paper presents the most abundant SLIPs for the Nakdong River lowlands, drawing from data accumulated through decades of research in the Nakdong River estuary."

    "abstract": "Sediment transport and mixing in estuaries impact a number of ecosystem services, including the flux of nutrients and the mediation of turbidity of the water column, which in turn affect the health of seagrasses and other benthic primary producers. A key factor to predicting the direction and strength of sediment transport is the critical shear stress required to erode sediment from the bed. But the erodibility of fine sediments is poorly constrained because of the complicated interactions between grainsize, consolidation, and biological factors. This study assessed the evolution of critical shear stress and erodibility of the seabed in southwest Florida, USA after the intense disturbance of Hurricane Ian. We also compared how the evolution of the bed differed in a location that has had extensive development with a nearby but undeveloped bay with no anthropogenic development. Erodibility and critical shear stress were measured with Gust-type erosional chambers. Profiles of 7 Be and Xradiographs were used to determine the extent of new sediment deposition and bioturbation. Hydrodynamics were measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler. Hurricane Ian initially eroded the seabed down to a consolidated layer with high critical shear stress (1–1.5 Pa) and low erodibility at both sites. In the subsequent months, new sediments were deposited and rapid bioadvection of the top 6 cm ensued. The shear stress was reduced (~ 0.25 Pa) and erodibility increased by the end of the study. Recovery was more rapid in the undeveloped site because the hydrodynamics were more energetic. Both sites returned to stability within one year of the passage of the storm."

    "abstract": "Shallow marine environments, including the continental shelf, are important in the global carbon cycle in which organic carbon is transported from land, produced within the ocean, and buried in sediments. The territorial waters of Korea (Republic of Korea) encompass predominantly shallow continental shelves. This study examined the organic carbon distribution of surficial sediments in the territorial waters of Korea to approximate the carbon stocks in the surficial sediments of the seafloor at a national scale. For the estimation, the reported data (mean grain size (MGS), total organic carbon (TOC) content, and dry bulk density) around the Korean Peninsula were documented and organized to evaluate the potential for carbon sequestration in the territorial waters of Korea. The distribution of the MGS and the TOC content in surficial sediments varied regionally according to the depositional processes, but they exhibited the typical characteristics of marine sediments whose TOC content increased as the MGS decreased. Among the four zones (A, B, C, and D) in the territorial waters of Korea, the estimated total carbon stock was highest (2.27 × 10 6 Mg C) in zone A and lowest (1.04 × 10 6 Mg C) in zone C, despite zone C having the highest carbon stock per unit area (1.64 Mg C/ha). However, for a precise assessment of long-term carbon stock and sequestration rates, more comprehensive and robust data along with representative sedimentation rates and the vertical profiles of the TOC content are essential at a national scale."

    "title": "Identification of sediment provenance of mineral and geochemical elements in the Yangtze River and the Yellow River: a review",
    "abstract": "Rivers are a primary source of sediment in continental shelf regions, and the identification of sediment provenance in river systems is crucial to understanding the transport processes, sediment flux, and changes in marine sedimentary environments. Detrital and clay mineral composition, along with geochemical elemental characteristics, serve as key tracers for sediment sources. This study compiles source-discrimination indicators from sediment samples of the Yangtze River (YZR) and Yellow River (YER). While qualitative comparisons between the two rivers show some consensus, discrepancies arise due to differences in studied components, grain size selections, and mineral-specific analyses. Additionally, quantifying riverine contributions to marine sediments remains a significant challenge. Future research should focus on characterizing detrital and clay minerals across grain-size fractions, integrated with advanced instruments and techniques to examine single minerals comprehensively (e.g., geochemistry, chronology, and isotopes). Such efforts will enhance the identification of end-member components of riverine sediments, estimate the specific contributions of terrestrial transport materials, and investigate their dispersion and distribution patterns in continental shelf regions. This research provides new insights into the source-to-sink processes of sediment in the East Asian marginal seas."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the deep-sea morphology and sedimentary processes within the Santa Catarina Plateau and the Vema Channel, prominent features crucial for influencing bottom circulation in the western South Atlantic and regulating the exchange of deep and bottom waters between the Argentine and Brazil basins. The study leverages a unique dataset comprising multibeam data for generating detailed digital terrain models and sub-bottom profiling records, alongside numerical modeling of bottom current velocities (GLORYS12V1 reanalysis). Numerous sediment waves, predominantly cresting mudwaves and mass-wasting deposits associated with steeper sea floor gradients, were identified in the region, aligning with findings from the Argentinian and South Brazilian slopes. The investigation of these features contributes not only to the identification of contourites but also to the enhancement of understanding regarding deep-water circulation within the 3,500-to-4,500-meter range. This depth range serves as a critical transition zone between the Argentine and Brazil basins and plays a pivotal role in elucidating the northward distribution of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), an integral component of the Atlantic meridional circulation. In contrast to prior studies that focused on specific regions of the plateau, this research offers a comprehensive overview of the region’s morphology and sedimentary processes, thereby advancing comprehension of deep-water circulation dynamics between the Argentinian and Brazilian basins."

    "title": "Risk assessment of rip current in China: based on data from 33 beaches",
    "abstract": "Rip currents are narrow, powerful seaward currents that frequently occur on sandy shores, posing a significant hazard by quickly pulling swimmers into deeper waters, leading to numerous drowning incidents. As such, they are among the most dangerous natural threats in coastal zones. The Ω-RTR (dimensionless fall velocity-relative tide range) model is a widely recognised framework for classifying the geomorphic and dynamical states of beaches. Although this model does not explicitly predict the location, timing, and intensity of rip currents, it estimates the likelihood of rip currents forming at specific beach types. In this study, 33 representative touring beaches along the coasts of China were studied and the rip current risk of these beaches was evaluated with the Ω-RTR model. According to this classification, beaches can be categorised into eight types, seven of which are presented among the 33 Chinese beaches studied in this paper, and notably, the Ultra-Dissipative (UD) type is absent. The most common three beach types identified are Barred (B), Low Tide Bar/Rip (LTBR), and Non-Barred Dissipative (NBD). The former two are predominantly located in Shandong, Fujian, and Hainan provinces, while the latter is mainly found in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces. The rip current risk across these beaches is primarily assessed as medium to high, with low-risk beaches primarily situated in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces. There is minimal month-to-month variation in beach type and rip current risk along the Yellow Sea, Bohai Sea, the coast of Zhejiang Province, and the coasts of Hainan Island and Guangxi Province. However, notable seasonal variations in beach type and rip current risk are observed in Fujian Province. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of rip current risk across key coastal touring beaches in China. Additionally, it contributes to the expansion of data sources for the beach geomorphic-dynamical classification system. The findings offer valuable insights for enhancing the safety of beachgoers and promoting the sustainable development of China’s coastal tourism industry."

    "abstract": "The 1956 Amorgos earthquake, with a magnitude of Ms = 7.5, caused a destructive tsunami in the Central Aegean Sea. Two gravity cores were collected south of Amorgos and Anafi Islands, respectively, confirming submarine landslide deposits linked to the 1956 earthquake. The 1956 Mass Transport Deposits (MTDs) vary in thickness from 55 to 100 cm in the cores. The predominant fraction of the sediments is clay, followed by sand (in the core next to Amorgos Isl.), while silt registers a maximum of 26% of total in the sediments. These MTDs are characterized by their grey color, erosional surfaces and their flows are mostly cohesive. Additionally, values of gamma density, P-wave velocity and magnetic susceptibility are higher compared with the above and underlying sediments. They are referred to as lithoclastic, with a lack of foraminiferal material and calcite dilution and presenting low values of strontium (Sr) and Sr/Rb ratio. All physical and chemical signatures can distinguish the MTD deposit during 1956 from the above and underlying sediments. Finding deposits with similar characteristics in the wider area can be attributed to this event and offer a better understanding of the extent of the multiple and simultaneous MTDs during this particular occurrence of seismic activity. The area is vulnerable to mass flows, as cores are composed of turbiditic layers before and after this event, which are likely the result of the high seismicity. Further study is required to reveal which conditions are conducive for the remobilization of the sediments. The area displays very low hemipelagic sedimentation and sedimentation processes mainly consist of Mass Transport Deposits and turbidites."

    "abstract": "This study focusses on the processes that control the morphodynamics of the seabed in the shoaling wave domain, widely known as the shoreface. Shoreface morphodynamics is not only controlled by the local wave climate but also by associated wave- and wind-driven currents, the grain-size, and antecedent geomorphology. This paper provides basic information on sedimentological action of monochromatic waves at the seabed in the shoaling zone to the non-specialist without him-/herself having to solve the complex equations before arriving at workable solutions. It is emphasized that the traditional oceanographically defined wave base (0.5 L 0 ) is not relevant in a geological/sedimentological context and should be replaced by a grain-size dependent effective wave base (EWB). Furthermore, open ocean swell-dominated shorefaces have to be distinguished from those of marginal seas dominated by local wind-generated waves. For convenience, a collection of tables and diagrams are provided in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) attached to this paper. They highlight the depths of effective wave bases for a range of grain sizes, wave heights and wave periods between 2 and 16 s."

    "title": "Loss prediction of carbon stocks caused by Spartina alterniflora clearing in coastal wetlands of Yancheng, China",
    "abstract": "Spartina alterniflora as a C 4 plant has strong capacity for sequestering carbon, and due to its widespread establishment, potentially contributes to improving the carbon absorption capacity of coastal wetlands. However, its continuous expansion has seriously threatened the security and sustainable development of coastal wetland ecosystems. To cope with these issues, S. alterniflora clearing has been actively implemented in China in recent years. In this study, the CA-Markov model was applied to predict the spatial distribution of S. alterniflora in Yancheng coastal wetlands under natural growth conditions without human intervention in 2025 and 2030. The carbon stock loss was assessed by comparing the carbon stocks of S. alterniflora under natural and artificial clearing conditions. The inversion models of vegetation coverage and biomass were established to estimate the loss of carbon stocks caused by S. alterniflora clearing in Yancheng coastal wetlands. The area dominated by S. alterniflora in Yancheng coastal wetlands in 2025 and 2030 was predicted to be 176 km 2 and 205 km 2 , and the average vegetation coverage was 0.73 and 0.75, respectively. Compared with 2022, the area increased by 47 km 2 in 2025 and 76 km 2 in 2030. From 1987 to 2022, carbon stocks of S. alterniflora in Yancheng coastal wetlands increased rapidly at first and then decreased slowly, from 0.26 × 10 5 t in 1987 to 1.41 × 10 5 t in 2022, with a maximum value of 1.65 × 10 5 t in 2002. By 2025 and 2030, the carbon stock loss caused by S. alterniflora clearing was predicted to be 1.93 × 10 5 t and 2.35 × 10 5 t, which was equivalent to a release of 7.08 × 10 5 t and 8.62 × 10 5 t of carbon dioxide. In 2025 and 2030, the loss of carbon stocks in section S4 (from Sheyang estuary to Doulong port) accounted for 33% and 29% of the total loss, and was the most seriously affected area. The study provided basic data for carbon compensation after S. alterniflora clearing and technical support for regional carbon management to aid future land management decisions."

    "abstract": "Modeling the subsurface structures and their geometries is a crucial task for understanding the tectonic background of the region. Within this scope, the current paper aims to define the subsurface structures of the Aegean Sea through a two-dimensional (2D) modeling approach. In this 2D modeling, satellite Bouguer gravity anomaly and magnetic data, which represent the novelty of the article, have been used for the first time in this region. Removing the regional field, the construction of the 2D model has been created along a defined profile. The modeled gravity data show that the body, which is evaluated as a magmatic intrusion, located in the southern Aegean volcanic arc region extends to the Moho depth. The presence of a high-density mass sliding into the Hellenic trench as a result of the subduction movement has also been revealed in this study. In addition, the average depths of the shallow causative bodies obtained from the power spectrum analysis of the magnetic data have positively correlated with the depths determined in the 2D model. Intense magnetic anomalies observed around the Biga Peninsula and Aegean volcanic islands were modeled with the control of the Edremit-1 borehole and it is evaluated that these anomalies in the region could be associated with the presence of volcanic rocks observed in the Edremit-1 well. On the other hand, the correlation between gravity data and seismological data has indicated the regions in which the mantle has been uplifted in the current study."

    "title": "Experimental investigation of wave-driven sediment resuspension in both following and opposing currents",
    "abstract": "Vegetation in estuarine tidal flats exerts a significant impact on the hydrodynamic properties and sediment transport dynamics in the nearshore zone. However, there is a scarcity of studies examining the distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) on vegetated beds under the combination of waves and unidirectional currents. Studies on the effects of combined waves and opposing current conditions are even more lacked. In the present paper, a set of flume experiments were conducted using the rigid submerged vegetation and suspended sediment. Vegetation canopies with aligned/staggered configurations were tested under combined waves with both following (current direction is consistent with wave propagation) and opposing currents. Results illustrate that the flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) were various for vegetation configurations and wave-current flow conditions. The near-bed concentration of suspended sediment rises with increasing wave height in both wave-only and wave-current flow scenarios, and it also tends to increase monotonically with the time-averaged TKE. Quadrant analysis shows that the sweep ( u ' < 0, w ' > 0) event is more dominant in following flow conditions, while the ejection phenomenon ( u ' > 0, w ' < 0) is found to be more pronounced under opposing currents. Furthermore, the presence of vegetation notably amplified the near-bed concentration of suspended sediments, while under wave-current interaction, suspended sediment concentration over vegetation beds may either increase or decrease compared to waves alone."

    "title": "Clast composition of biogenic calcareous sediments from some coral reefs of the Mexican Tropical Atlantic",
    "abstract": "Sediments are a main component of the coral reef framework, which are composed by calcareous bioclasts, non-skeletal carbonates, and terrigenous siliciclasts. Extensive work has been done to determine the bioclast composition of the coral reefs in the Western Tropical Atlantic. Notwithstanding, the sediment composition of coral reefs in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico, which are influenced by fluvial discharge, remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the bioclast composition of the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico reefs, and their differences to the reefs of the Mexican Caribbean, and those of the Western Tropical Atlantic. Surface sediment samples were collected at the reef flat zone of ten coral reefs in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Caribbean. From the results it can be concluded that the clast composition of reef sediments is the result of several processes with high spatio-temporal variability. Terrigenous siliciclasts are an important component of reef sediments in the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico. The clast composition of the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Scleractinia > Aggregates > Halimeda > CCA > Gastropoda), is different to that of the Mexican Caribbean and the Western Tropical Atlantic reefs. Applying statistical multivariate analyses, we found that four groups of reefs differ in their clast composition, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and Florida dominated by Halimeda , the Bahamas with non-skeletal clasts as the most abundant, and the fourth group formed by the fringing reefs of Roatan, and some other localities, with Scleractinians as the dominant clast. Also, clast composition differs between oceanic reefs ( Halimeda -dominated), nearshore reefs (Scleractinia-dominated), and carbonate platforms (abiotic clasts dominated). In average the most abundant bioclasts in the Western Tropical Atlantic reefs are Scleractinians > Halimeda > Mollusks > non-skeletal clasts > calcareous macroalgae."

    "title": "Evolution in the Yellow River Estuary over the past 20 years by sediment load variation and sea-level rise",
    "abstract": "Stability of the modern estuarine area is influenced by sea-level rise under global warming and the implementation of a Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme. The Yellow River is one of the largest rivers in the world, and the deltaic area is critical in the source-to-sink process and regional sustainability due to its socioeconomic and ecological significance. In this study, coastline migration and coastal area change in the Yellow River Estuary (YRE) during 2002–2021 were quantified by using Landsat remote sensing images. The influences from sediment load variation and sea-level rise on the evolution of YRE were investigated. The results indicate that the coastline length of the YRE increased from 69.45 km to 93.34 km, and the total estuarine area expanded from 271.01 km 2 to 300.52 km 2 during 2002–2021. The YRE tended to accrete eastward during 2002–2008, to retreat during 2009–2016, and to accrete northward during 2017–2021, controlled by river channel migration and sediment load change. Our results show that every 100 million tons of sediment discharge induced estuarine area increase of 5.80 km 2 in the current YRE (Qing 8 estuary), while a 1-millimeter sea-level rise resulted in a decrease of 0.35 km 2 in the abandoned YRE (Qingshuigou estuary). Factor analysis of the Qing 8 estuary area driving forces reveals that the cumulative sediment load and sea-level rise contribute 4.57 km 2 /a and − 1.72 km 2 /a, respectively. Therefore, to maintain the current Qing 8 estuary area, the critical sediment load that the Yellow River needs to transport annually is estimated to be 55.78 × 10 6 t."

    "abstract": "This study presents the first surficial sediment zonation based on an analysis of backscatter data and sediment samples acquired during the YTEC-GTGM0 and AMPY1 (2017 and 2022, respectively) aboard the R/V Austral. Data were collected using a Kongsberg EM122 echosounder operating at 12 kHz, covering a 3882 km 2 area that includes the Sloggett Submarine Canyon and its interfluve with Valentín Submarine Canyon, located within the ‘Yaganes Marine Protected Area’ in the Tierra del Fuego Continental Margin. A 75 × 75 m grid was generated from the backscatter data, and both supervised and unsupervised clustering algorithms were applied, resulting in four distinct acoustic groups. A qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the suitability of each clustering method for dB value determination. The acoustic groups were then validated using nine surficial sediment samples collected from the study area. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the extreme values of the dB scale and sediment types: lower dB values (< -26 dB) correspond to fine-grained sediments (silt and sandy silt), while higher dB values (> -18 dB) correlate with coarse-grained sediments (sand and gravel). However, intermediate dB values show poor correlation with specific sediment types, likely due to the influence of mixed sediments and geomorphological factors such as seafloor slope and subsurface layering. Notably, the seafloor slope above 7° was found to significantly influence backscatter values, highlighting the complexity of acoustic interpretation in steep environments. This study provides the first detailed classification of geohabitats in the AMPY, enabling the creation of a map that reveals three main seafloor types: fine-grained, mixed-grained, and coarse-grained that were associated with soft muddy, mixed, and hard and rugged geohabitats. The findings underscore the utility of backscatter data for seafloor characterization, particularly in extreme dB ranges, while also highlighting the challenges of interpreting intermediate values. This work contributes to a better understanding of the benthic environment in marine protected areas, supporting future conservation and management efforts."

    "title": "Is the coastal vulnerability index a suitable index? Review and proposal of alternative indices for coastal vulnerability to sea level rise",
    "abstract": "The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) has been widely applied around the world. This study provides a review of the suitability of the variables and mathematical expression of the CVI and proposes a new Integrated Coastal Vulnerability Index (ICVI), comparing both indices for 4 study areas in the southern Caribbean. The ICVI assesses vulnerability to sea level rise by integrating the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) and the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SVI). Regarding the variables that constitute the indices, it is noted that the CVI includes vulnerability and hazard variables and therefore it should be considered a risk index rather than a vulnerability index. The EVI includes geomorphological vulnerability variables, like the CVI, but also ecological ones. Regarding the mathematical expression, the use of the arithmetic mean versus the formula proposed for the CVI is discussed based on the comparison of the results obtained for EVI and SVI in the 4 study areas. In addition, the use of absolute (between 0 and 1) or relative (based on percentiles) limits in these indices, and the use of weights or not, are also discussed. The conclusion is that the use of relative thresholds necessarily forces the identification of very low to very high vulnerability zones for any study, and the use of weights on the variables increases the subjectivity of the assessment, all of which impedes the comparability of the index at a global level. Therefore, the ICVI, with the formula based on the arithmetic mean, with absolute limits between 0 and 1 and without variable weightings, is preferable to the CVI for use at the global level."

    "title": "An influence of the Antarctic bottom water currents on the formation of the upper sediment cover in the Vema Fracture Zone, Central Atlantic",
    "abstract": "The DSDP holes 26/353 have been drilled in the central part of the Vema Fracture Zone (VFZ) to investigate the sediment infilling, however, the upper 96 m of the sediments were not sampled. Therefore, the age and character of the uppermost sediments at a water depth of > 5 km remain unknown. During the cruises 60 and 65 of the RV Akademik Ioffe in 2021 and 2023, respectively, the high-resolution sub-bottom profiling (SBP) and coring of the uppermost sediment cover at DSDP site 26/353 location have been conducted to address the sediment age and origin, as well as the mean sedimentation rates. The results of sub-bottom profiling demonstrate an alternation of acoustically transparent and stratified units reflecting cyclic changes in sedimentation mode. Grain size and microfossil data from three sediment cores, supplemented by the AMS- 14 C dating support an assumption on the contourite and turbidite-contourite origin of the upper transparent sediment layer, represented by terrigenous mud and underlying the postglacial mainly pelagic calcareous cap. Our results suggest the eastward transport of terrigenous, commonly turbiditic, sediments by the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and their transformation into contourites along the Vema valley."

    "title": "High-resolution DEMs reveal multi-scale roughness of oyster reefs via smartphone photogrammetry",
    "abstract": "Oysters, as ecosystem engineers, possess unique bed roughness that considerably influences local hydrodynamics, affecting both surrounding fields of currents and waves as well as the growth of oysters. This study aims to quantify and interpret the surface roughness characteristics of oyster reefs using smartphone-based Structure from Motion (SfM) technology. We constructed millimeter-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of two contrasting oyster reefs along the Jiangsu coast, China: a live reef on a submerged breakwater in Sheyang, and a degraded reef at Liyashan, Haimen. Results show similar overall roughness heights for both sites (total roughness height k t = 19 ± 5 mm; root mean square roughness height k rms = 4 ± 1 mm). However, multi-scale roughness analysis revealed distinct morphological differences. The Sheyang reef exhibits sharper small-scale features, while the Liyashan reef shows blunter surfaces and more pronounced large-scale undulations. These surface characteristics of the reefs are directly related to the occurrence of oysters, the degree of surface sediment cover, and the bedforms beneath the surface oyster shells. This study provides valuable roughness parameters and introduces a multi-scale analysis method, enhancing our understanding of oyster reef surfaces. These findings contribute to more accurate predictions of hydrodynamic roughness and offer insights into the complex interactions between oyster reef morphology and hydrodynamics."

    "title": "Shoaling of the gas hydrate stability zone inferred from 3D seismic data of the Cauvery basin",
    "abstract": "The Cauvery basin, located in the southern part of the eastern margin of India, was formed due to the frontier failed rift basin between India and Sri Lanka. This basin has an active petroleum system, and two gas discoveries were made in 2011, namely the Barracuda gas discovery and the North Dorado gas discovery. The study area is located near the Barracuda gas discovery, where bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) are observed, indicating the presence of gas hydrates and free gas. The BSR in seismic data marks the base of the gas hydrate stability zone (BHSZ). The 3D seismic data analyzed in a small region of the Cauvery offshore basin, and the analysis revealed a continuous and stable BSR at water depths between 945 m and 1000 m. The BSR is observed 90 m below the seafloor (mbsf) from seismic data and computed stability for the same region shows that the BHSZ is at 90 mbsf at 1000 m bathymetry, which agrees well with the seismic. Our study attempts to study the stability variation by changing the sea bottom temperature, the geothermal gradient, and hydrostatic pressure. The historical sea surface temperature (SST) recorded in gravity core SK157-14 shows that the SST has increased by ~ 2-2.5°C post-glacial maximum (LGM). The stability calculations made using the Miles equation and this SST increase indicate that the BHSZ shallowed by 75 m post-LGM. The analysis shows that the increase in GTG by 3.7° C/km resulted in shifting of he BHSZ by 20 m. Increasing the pressure by ~ 1 MPa has resulted in the deepening of BHSZ by ~ 40 m. The similarity attribute of the BSR horizon shows high similarity in the BSR horizon. Further to the seismic analysis, the well-log data available in the study area reveal the existence of free gas. From the study, we infer that the shallow occurrence of BSR and its stable behavior can be attributed to the high sea-bottom temperature, very low sedimentation rate, low geothermal gradients, and the lithology of the study area."

    "title": "Biases in annual density banding with implications for high-resolution growth chronologies in the massive starlet coral (Siderastrea siderea)",
    "abstract": "The aragonitic skeletons of massive corals (Scleractinia) are commonly used as biological and paleoenvironmental archives based on their annual density banding. In case of high-resolution proxy studies, however, taxon-specific biases related to the skeletal architecture of the selected coral species can occur, which may impact the resulting skeletal growth chronologies. This study focusses on the quantification of high-resolution skeletal density records in the massive starlet coral Siderastrea siderea from a nearshore reef environment at the southern coast of Belize (western Caribbean Sea) by using two-dimensional grid-scanning americium-241 ( 241 Am) gamma densitometry. Multiple linear sample pathways were systematically selected through central corallite areas (i.e., around the columella) and the corresponding walls (synapticulotheca) of contemporaneously formed corallites in S. siderea . By following this approach, annual density banding (or distortions in its formation) can be identified and related to the general architectural elements and/or to variations in the longitudinal alignment of corallites. The demarcation of high-density bands is often more clearly developed in the corallite walls than around the columella. Therefore, future high-resolution linear skeletal density chronologies should be established based on the more robust corallite walls to reduce such biases in density banding of S. siderea corals."

    "title": "A laboratory study on wave Attenuation by oyster reefs-mangrove system",
    "abstract": "In a coastal ecological project aimed at wave attenuation through mangroves, incorporating oyster reefs as a complementary component to establish an “oyster reefs + mangrove” wave attenuation system could enhance the survival probability of mangroves, as well as improve the overall effectiveness of wave attenuation. This study investigates and proposes an innovative wave attenuation system consisting of oyster reefs and mangroves with various configurations. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a wave flume using artificial models of mangroves and oyster reefs to examine the impact of the system on wave attenuation, thereby providing a scientific foundation for coastal ecological restoration projects. The findings demonstrate that the wave attenuation coefficient exhibited a positive correlation with both the significant wave height and oyster reef height, as well as with mangrove density. Conversely, it displayed a negative association with water depth and period. Notably, oyster reefs substantially affected the wave attenuation. When three layers of oyster reefs are integrated with staggered dense mangroves, the system demonstrates optimal wave attenuation, with coefficients ranging from 0.38 to 0.42. The incorporation of oyster reefs within mangroves significantly enhances the capacity of wave attenuation, resulting in an increase of up to 0.26 in the wave attenuation coefficient. Moreover, although the combined wave attenuation coefficient of the individual mangroves and oyster reefs was higher than that of the system, the system’s overall wave attenuation surpassed that of either component. A theoretical equation has been formulated to quantify wave attenuation in the oyster reefs-mangrove system, aiming to provide practical guidance for coastal restoration projects. Maximizing the height of oyster reefs in areas with low water depth and pairing them with staggered dense mangroves is recommended to reduce wave energy in coastal restoration projects. The most effective wave reduction strategy for areas with high water depth is a combination of tall oyster reefs and staggered or in-line clusters of dense mangroves."

    "title": "Energy partitioning in global marine sedimentation: tidal, geothermal, and solar radiation contributions",
    "abstract": "Earth surface sedimentary processes involve the conversion of energy from tidal friction, geothermal heat release, and solar radiation. However, the net power consumption by sediment dynamic processes has received little attention, despite its relevance to the scale and evolution of sedimentary systems. This study aims to integrate the sediment and sedimentary sequence generation rates and the related net power consumption, associated with rock weathering, biogenic sedimentation (organic particle, biogenic reef, and carbonate detrital deposits), continental shelf and coastal sedimentation (estuary and delta, sandy and gravel beach, and tidal flat deposits), and deep-sea sedimentation (sediment gravity flow, contour current, and pelagic-hemipelagic deposits). The results indicate that, although the oceans presently contain more than half of the global sediment mass, the net power consumed by the various sedimentation processes accounts only for a minute fraction of the total power from their respective energy sources. Such an observation can be explained by macroscopic patterns of energy balance, limitations imposed by rock weathering and ecosystem spatial constraints, and the time scales of sedimentary material cycling. Moreover, the total volume and temporal evolution of Earth’s sediment are controlled by sediment generation and removal processes; at the present time, it is likely that the sedimentary mass has reached its maximum in quantity, and the majority of sedimentary records have already disappeared from Earth’s surface environments. These analyses highlight a series of scientific issues that require further investigation, such as the energy conversion processes of weathering and biogenic activities, variations and adjustability of sedimentation power budgets, and changes in the completeness of sedimentary records over time."

    "title": "Shoreline change and coastal erosion: an analysis of long-term change and adaptation strategies in coastal Ghana",
    "abstract": "This study analysed long-term shoreline change, the influence of erosion, and adaptation strategies in coastal Ghana. The change between 1972 and 2021 was analysed using Landsat satellite images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS v.5.0), and adaptation strategies were revealed through field observations. The End Point Rate (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) were used to estimate the rate of change, whereas the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) were used to calculate the distances of change. The coefficient of shoreline armouring (K) index was used to evaluate the grade of artificial or human interventions on the coast. The erosion rates for the EPR (− 107.6 m/year, or 95.0%) and LRR (− 75.7 m/year, or 99.3%) were higher than the accretion rates of (28.5 m/year, or 5.0%) and (33.6 m/year, or 0.7%), respectively. The NSM recorded maximum erosion (− 14,080 to − 10,840 m) and accretion (1107 to 2135 m) with an average distance of − 4943.1 m. The SCE estimated a maximum (14,080.5 m) and minimum (813.8 m) distances with an average distance change of 5557.9 m. The central coast experienced erosion at average rates of − 119.0 m/yr, − 89.6 m/yr, and − 94.0 m/yr, according to EPR, LRR, and WLR statistics. The eastern coast observed lower erosion rates than the central coast, with rates of − 75.3 m/yr, − 53.2 m/yr, and − 41.9 m/yr for the EPR, LRR, and WLR statistics, respectively. Since 1972, there has been a significant increase in artificial coastal structures on Ghana's central and eastern coasts. The central coast has reached a maximal level of shoreline armouring index, while the eastern coast has reached a minimal level. Although hard protective measures have been implemented on most parts of the coast for adaptation, improved policy initiatives on soft and nature-based protection measures are encouraged based on their favourable ecological impact and economic effectiveness."

    "title": "Seismic stratigraphy of the Bandırma Bay since sea-level lowstand, Sea of Marmara, Türkiye",
    "abstract": "Near coasts and shelves are strongly affected by the hydrodynamic forces and involves important information about the long term and permanent changes. Understanding the past dynamic transformations of shelves and near coasts can shed the future projections about effects of climate changes. High-resolution seismic and multibeam bathymetry data shed light on sedimentation since the last sea level lowstand in the Bandırma Bay, southern shelf area of the Marmara Sea. Five different seismic units were identified from the bottom upward based on seismic stratigraphic analysis, which are bounded by the reflection surfaces. Differential hydrological and depositional processes in the bay are shown by the definition and mapping of these unique seismic units and surfaces in the shallow sedimentary record: The water level in the basin crossed the threshold between the two basins, and advancing flows began from the north to the western basin. The basin continued to fill with water, and progressive depositions were interrupted with the onlaps of U3–4. The water level rose above the threshold in both basins, resulting in the two lakes becoming a single lake and the creation of marine conditions. The initial deposition in the eastern basin was fluvial, deposited in the form of regressive systems tracts. The overall morphology and stratigraphic settings observed in Bandırma Bay have nearly the same characteristics as those observed in the Sea of Marmara (like northern and western Marmara shelf, Gemlik Bay, Büyükçekmece Bay etc.) oceanography, implying that similar hydrodynamic conditions and erosional and depositional processes are controlled mainly by sea level changes controlled by climate changes related to morphological properties."

    "title": "Morphological and geological responses of barrier estuaries to dam-opening systems",
    "abstract": "River discharge depending on the dam gate operation method is an important factor underlying changes in estuarine sedimentation dynamics, but comprehensive studies are limited by data collection constraints. The hydrological operation of Nakdong Dam, designed to prevent seawater intrusion by opening during ebb tides and heavy rains and closing during flood tides, presents an ideal setting for such investigations. This study focused on the Nakdong River Estuary (NRE), utilizing aerial photography, bathymetry data, and sedimentation rate data to determine alterations in sediment transport and deposition patterns within the two tributary estuaries. Spatial discrepancies in sedimentation patterns across the eastern and western regions of the NRE were particularly evident in the spatial variations of textural characteristics and sedimentation rates. An enhanced ebb tidal prism resulting from dam gate opening in the eastern region caused the development of erosional topography and a rough depositional environment, forming a landward migrating (transgressive) barrier island system. Conversely, the predominantly closed dam gates in the western region maintained a consistent deposition pattern due to a regular tidal prism, facilitating the formation of sedimentary topography and fine sediment deposition. Consequently, barrier islands followed a seaward building (prograding) system. Therefore, the results suggested a role of modern dam gate operation as a major sedimentation mechanism, providing valuable insights for the sustainable management of estuarine sediment environments."

    "title": "Shell size variation of pteropod Heliconoides inflatus: inferences on Indian Ocean carbonate chemistry during late Quaternary",
    "abstract": "The current study is an effort to understand the relationship between the average shell size and Limacina Dissolution Index (LDX) of pteropod species, Heliconoides inflatus as a metric for shell calcification using several cores, ranging in age from recent to 1.2 Myr. The current study is based on the variability of H. inflatus average shell size, LDX, and fragmentation ratio (FR) and their correlation among different spatial and temporal sediment core records from the Northern Indian Ocean. Results suggest that in the cores collected above the Aragonite lysocline (Aly) and the Aragonite Compensation Depth (ACD) (SPC 05, 06, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, and NGHP-17), the average shell size values exhibited larger shells during the stadials/glacial periods (Little Ice Age (LIA), Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 3, 6, 10 − 9 transition etc.) which corresponds to lower LDX values. However, the cores beyond the ACD (SK168, AAS11, and RVS2) show larger shell size values during the warm interstadials (e.g., Bølling–Allerød) with higher FR. The variability in shell size and LDX shows an indication of the carbonate ion saturation in the water column over glacial/interglacial time scales and the impact of changing atmospheric CO 2 in the atmosphere. However, the factors adding to the carbonate ion saturation within the water column could be varied physiographically. The calcification proxy complements the dissolution proxies and reveals that the most intense aragonite dissolution occurred during the Holocene and interstadials/interglacials."

    "title": "Grain size of gravel: recent progress on sampling, analysis and calculation",
    "abstract": "Gravel beaches serve as both important recreational destinations and natural barriers against wave erosion. In the context of global climate change and sea level rising, the use of gravel for beach nourishment has become an increasingly favored option for soft shoreline protection solutions. However, sampling and analyzing the grain size of gravel have always been challenging in this field of research. This challenge not only hampers the accurate prediction of gravel beach morphodynamics but also adds uncertainty to designs of beach nourishment projects. Here, we present three recent progresses in grain size sampling and analysis of gravel sediments. (1) Minimum sampling mass for sieving method. By assuming a normal distribution and considering the standard deviation and the grain size of the coarsest particle, we derived a method for calculating the minimum sampling mass, for instance, a gravel sample with a standard deviation of 4.0 φ and the coarsest grain size of 64 mm would require a minimum sampling mass not exceeding 48 kg. (2) Digital photograph-based automatic grain size and shape analysis technique. We have developed hardwares for measuring gravel grain size and shape and have written corresponding software, namely the Gravel Grain Size and Shape Automatic Measurement System (GraSSAMS). This system caters to both laboratory and fieldwork requirements, enabling measurements of particles within the range of 1–330 mm. (3) Grain size parameter calculation for samples analysed with a comprehensive approach. When applying a comprehensive approach (combining laser and sieving methods) to analyze the grain size of gravel-sand-mud mixtures, we observed overlap between the results of the laser and sieving methods. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms, both of which yield highly consistent results. Finally, we discuss two questions: (1) Is there a standard technique for gravel grain size analysis? (2) How will technology for automated identification of gravel grain size and shape evolve in the future? Exploring these questions can help to better understand the morphology and evolution of gravel beaches."

    "title": "Rheological experiments on dense silty sediments under steady shear loadings",
    "abstract": "Dense silty sediments exhibit complex rheological behaviors due to their composition, which consists of sand, silt and clay. However, few studies have been conducted on the variation in the rheological properties of this material, especially for that with different particle size compositions. This paper investigated the rheological properties of ten silty samples with various kaolin contents. A set of experiments was conducted with a MCR302 rheometer by measuring the flow curves, deformation curves, and temporal responses of shear stress. The results indicate that dense silty sediments undergo a solid–liquid transition as the shear rate continuously increases. Due to the large bonding forces between fine particles, the samples with a smaller median particle diameter ( D 50 ) have a higher critical shear stress during this transition. Smaller-diameter samples also commonly exhibit thixotropic behavior. The rheological behaviors are fit by both the Power-Law model and the Herschel–Bulkley model. The Herschel–Bulkley model was more suitable for samples with higher densities and smaller D 50 values, while the Power-Law model is more suitable for describing samples with densities between 1229.70 and 1596.39 kg/m 3 and D 50 sizes between 72.90 and 26.90 μm. The results of this paper are highly important for determining a rheological model for simulating sediment movement in silty estuaries and turbidity current in deep-sea areas."

This research aims to identify the primary geochemical indicators that can be used to interpret the sediment sources and interbasin relationships among the Campos, Santos, Pelotas, and Punta del Este Basins. Building on previous conceptual models, this work examines the influence of Argentinean and Paraná Basin sources. Additionally, the effectiveness of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in identifying geochemical differences between sediment basins in the southwestern Atlantic margin is explored, and a correct discrimination of more than 95% is obtained. This study delves into depositional conditions and sediment sources, and the metal signatures in each one of the basins are evaluated. The distribution of sediments and their relationships with ocean circulation patterns are also examined. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of sediment dynamics and geochemical indicators in the context of the complex oceanographic and geological setting of the Southwestern Atlantic margin."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to assess the feasibility of using the shell of Callista umbonella for sclerochronology and sclerochemistry studies, with the goal of reconstructing the climatic conditions of the northern Persian Gulf, specifically the north of the Strait of Hormuz. One hundred bivalves of C. umbonella were collected from Bostanu in June 2020, and their shells were processed by removing organic matter, mounting, and preparing transverse sections. Ten shell samples were chosen for sclerochronology evaluation. Tidal data with 30-min accuracy were obtained from the hydrographic management database of the National Cartography Center of Iran, while sea surface temperature (SST) data in the studied area were extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data on board the Aqua satellite. For each month of mollusc life, one sample from a shell was taken, and the isotope ratio was analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). A total of 13 samples were analyzed. The results showed that the life of the sample was 572 days, and the growth bands evaluated were in good agreement with the tidal data. The growth rate showed a strong correlation with SST changes. By establishing a relationship between the aragonite equilibrium fractionation factor, the average monthly SST, and the results of sclerochemistry and IRMS analysis, the δ 18 O water value was removed from the previous function. Finally, the transfer function was developed to reconstruct weather conditions based on the relationship between SST in Celsius and δ 18 O shell value with regard to shell formation and environmental conditions during the time and place of biomineralization of the organism."

    "abstract": "Ferromanganese formations (FMF) are one of the major types of mineral deposits on the Eastern Arctic Shelf; however, there is no consensus on the mechanism of concretion formation and the source of ore and microelements to the FMF. Therefore, it is important to conduct a comprehensive study of the patterns of changes in the composition of FMF as a function of environmental conditions. Four representative ferromanganese formations collected from the shallow semi-enclosed Chaunskaya Bay (East Siberian Sea) were studied by inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry and X-ray powder diffraction to determine the origin and correlation of their composition with the regional conditions of sedimentation. The formations are completely composed of an iron X-ray amorphous phase (up to 90-95%), chlorite, quartz, and plagioclase. All samples were characterized by the high Fe contents (up to 28.9 wt%) compared to the Mn (0.27-13.0 wt%) and phosphorus contents (up to 4 wt%), which can be explained by the binding of the element in a mineral phase. The average REE content was 117 mg/kg, significantly lower than that in Arctic Ocean ferromenganese crusts, whereas comparable to that in nodules from the Kara and Chukchi seas. The post-Archean Australian shale normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of the studied samples showed the slight predominance enrichment of medium and heavy REE and the negative Ce anomalies. Comprehensive geochemical and mineralogical data indicate that the studied formations are of diagenetic origin with additional input of ore material from the submarine hydrothermal vent."

    "title": "Enhanced spatiotemporal fusion algorithm for long-term monitoring of intertidal zone topography",
    "abstract": "Global climate change and human activities exert dual pressures on intertidal zones, leading to significant alterations in their spatiotemporal distribution. Traditional topographic data collection methods in these regions are labor-intensive and resource-demanding, requiring considerable human and material inputs, and are often limited to localized areas. These challenges hinder large-scale, comprehensive monitoring efforts. In response, this study presents an improved Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion model, tailored to account for the inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity of intertidal zone topography. By integrating high-frequency modulation algorithms, we optimized the distribution of residuals, enhancing the overall accuracy and stability of the spatiotemporal model. We applied this enhanced algorithm to the central Jiangsu coastal tidal flats, where we successfully inverted the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the intertidal wetlands. The fused imagery produced by the algorithm demonstrated superior performance in quantitative assessments, as confirmed by the results of the All-round Performance Assessment. These results consistently outperformed alternative algorithms in terms of accuracy and resolution. Through interannual analysis of the generated DEM, we observed a clear trend: the area and volume of the intertidal zone first expanded and then contracted. This pattern is attributed to reduced sediment supply and localized human activities, which have altered the natural sedimentation and erosion dynamics. The improved algorithm not only provides a reliable method for simulating intertidal topography but also enables the monitoring of sedimentation and erosion in regions lacking direct observational data. This study addresses key challenges faced by satellite remote sensing technologies in accurately capturing intertidal zone topography, particularly in dynamic coastal environments, and offers a new approach for large-scale, long-term monitoring of these ecologically significant areas."

    "abstract": "Dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) change in the coastal zone driven by human and natural factors increases the urgency of studying the land-sea-scape pattern’s impacts on land and sea. Based on the LULC data of the Bohai Bay in 1979, 1989, 1999, 2008, and 2020, this study analyzed the characteristics of the spatial and temporal evolution of carbon storage in combination with the InVEST model, and revealed the impacts of change trajectories in LULC on carbon storage over five periods. The results of the study showed that the carbon storage in the Bohai Bay has decreased by 15.64% in the last 40 years, with a cumulative carbon loss of 0.91 × 10 7 Mg. A total of 213 driving process trajectories were identified through the land use trajectories, with 23 major driving processes (94.25% of all processes). The number of Mono + , Mono-, Multiple + , and Multiple- were 4, 5, 95, and 100, respectively. Among them, Mono- has the largest area, driving the reduction of carbon storage in the study area by 40.63 × 10 5 Mg from 1979 to 2020. The number of Natural + , Natural-, Human + , Human-, Couple + , and Couple- were 4, 5, 64, 61, 39, and 31, respectively. Of these, Human- had the largest area, driving a 59.67 × 10 5 Mg reduction in carbon storage in the study area during 1979–2020. This study will provide coastal zone management and decision-making with a reliable reference, and facilitate the exploration of the optimal way of land use structure and enhance ecosystem services."

    "title": "Interactions between headland sand bypassing and overpassing: a study case at Santinho’s Beach, Santa Catarina Island, Southern Brazil",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the interactions between headland sand bypassing and overpassing at Santinho’s beach, Brazil. Santinho receives sediments from the south (Moçambique) through headland bypassing and supplies sediment to the north (Ingleses) via headland bypassing and overpassing processes. To understand these interactions we: 1) identified if beach rotation process (often associated with bypassing) occurred in the area using CASSIE tool; 2) validated the headland sand bypassing using topography and geophysics data; 3) quantified the annual sediment transport around headlands, as well the transport to the backshore using numerical modelling. The findings identified a decadal beach rotation, sediment bypass, and negative pulses. A decadal sediment pulse entered the system in 2014, with indications of a subsequent pulse emerging. The presence of megaripples at both headlands confirmed sediment transport (bypassing) and its direction. Numerical models suggest that sediment transport around Ponta das Aranhas Headland amounts to 18,500 m³/year, while bypassing at Morro dos Ingleses Headland, about 12,000 m³/year, resulting in approximately 6,500 m³/year of remaining sediment transport to the backshore - aligning closely with the dune morphological evolution data (6,000 - 7,000 m³/year). Therefore, the results indicated that headland bypassing can control the sediment volume available for overpassing and overpassing rates can control the availability of sand for bypassing. Thus, it is evident that headland beaches should not be treated as closed compartments, even when the shoreline is relatively stable. These beaches can be transitional and dynamic environments where sediment can be transported around obstacles, whether through bypassing or overpassing, as seen at Santinho’s beach. This is the first time documentation of both bypassing and overpassing occurring at a single beach."

    "title": "Fossil diatoms and their significance for paleoenvironment construction on the shelf of Northern South China Sea",
    "abstract": "The analysis of fossil diatoms preserved in continental shelf sediments can provide detailed insights into the paleoecological and environmental history of marginal seas. In this study, we consider the development of the northern South China Sea based on a 302-m-long drilling core taken on the outer continental shelf. Diatoms were absent in more than half of the analyzed samples, a relatively low absolute abundance, so that a diatom-based biostratigraphy could not be established. The low absolute abundance suggests that diatom preservation was poor because of highly dynamic oceanographic conditions and significant biosilica dissolution. The dominance of coastal species and the intermittent presence of mostly tropical open-sea diatoms along the core reflects strong land-sea interactions and a current circulation influenced by sea-level fluctuations, following the glacial and interglacial cycles of the Quaternary period. This study provides clues concerning the evaluation of diatom fossils in micropaleontology, as well as their role in biogeochemical cycles within complex sedimentary processes across various marginal sea shelves."

    "title": "Structural framework and fault seal prediction of the central slyne basin prospect, Irish Atlantic margin",
    "abstract": "Predicting fault seals in prospective structural zones is crucial for evaluating the sealing capacity of hydrocarbon compartments. It is essential for assessing a seal's ability to retain hydrocarbons during their migration into reservoir systems. The Central Slyne Basin Prospect (CSBP), a geological trap within a horst block system, remains underexplored. This study aims to predict hydrocarbon column heights (H) in a Lower Jurassic play (Toarcian interval) within structural traps in the northern Central Slyne Basin by constructing a detailed structural framework. The CSBP, central to the basin's geometry, is the primary focus. Utilizing 3D seismic, well, and checkshot data, we performed seismic surface and fault interpretation of the Lower Jurassic play. Our approach integrates fault juxtaposition analysis, Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR) plotting, and permeability prediction to evaluate fault seal effectiveness and hydrocarbon migration potential. The results reveal the significant influence of fault dynamics on sealing behavior. Analyses of 3D fault plane juxtaposition, permeability plots, and SGR distribution indicate that the CSBP is highly sealed from surrounding structural closures, with an SGR of 40% across most of the fault plane. However, low SGR values (< 10%) near the fault tip may act as fluid migration pathways into the CSBP. The estimated hydrocarbon column height in the central prospect area is approximately 200 m, given the average SGR and a maximum burial depth of 3.5–4 km. These findings underscore the importance of detailed fault seal analysis for understanding reservoir behavior and predicting hydrocarbon migration in complex basins."

    "title": "Constraints of multi-source input and coastal transport on the composition of marine clay minerals: A case study of the northwestern shelf of the South China Sea",
    "abstract": "The clay mineral composition in the northwestern part of the South China Sea (SCS) continental shelf is influenced by multiple sources and coastal transport, which may differ from the northern deep basin of the SCS. In this study, clay mineral composition analysis was conducted on 80 surface sediment samples obtained in the Qizhou Island sea area. The results show that the dominant clay minerals in the surface sediments of the study area are illite (average content ∼ 46%) and smectite (average content ∼ 20%), with small amounts of kaolinite and chlorite (average content ∼ 17% each). Spatially, the illite content is lower near the coast and higher offshore. In comparison, the kaolinite content is higher near the coast and lower offshore, and smectite and chlorite exhibit patchy distributions. The clay minerals are influenced by various sources including the Pearl River, Taiwan Island, Hainan Island, and Leizhou Peninsula. The southwestward coastal currents transport material from small mountainous rivers in Taiwan Island and the world-class Pearl River, carrying it nearly a thousand kilometers along the northwestern SCS continental shelf. Simultaneously, small mountainous rivers in the eastern part of Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula also deliver some sediments to this region. Despite the strong influence of the world-class Pearl River, the clay minerals in the study area still reflect input signals from distant sources such as small mountainous rivers in Taiwan Island, as well as proximal small rivers in Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula. These findings are of significant importance for understanding source-to-sink processes and paleo-depositional environments in the northern SCS."

    "title": "Carbonate granulates from the continental shelf of the State of Paraíba, NE Brazil",
    "abstract": "The Brazilian continental shelf, particularly its northeast sector, is a conducive environment for the deposition of biogenic carbonate granules. In Brazil, the use of marine calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) derived from biogenic sediments is still in its early stages but its economic potential has become significant. Regarding the State of Paraíba, located in northeastern Brazil, it has been acknowledged that the survey and study of the sediments deposited on its continental shelf is not only of economic importance, but will lead to the understanding of their distribution and of the influence of geological, hydrodynamic, and biological processes in their deposition. For this purpose, 1096 sediment samples, collected during the GranMar project (Marine Granules of Brazil), were analyzed in this study. Sampling was conducted using a Van Veen-type grab sampler, and sampling depth was determined using an EDO 185 Oceanographic 12 kHz echosounder. The grain-size analyzes were conducted by sieving and CaCO 3 content determinations were performed using an adapted Bernard calcimeter. The bathymetric map revealed morphological evidence of distinct seafloor characteristics between the northern and southern regions of the shelf. The shelf is defined as carbonate-rich, with CaCO 3 contents above 75 wt.%, consisting mainly of bioclasts. The most abundant particle-size fractions range from gravel to sand. Three sedimentary facies were mapped along the continental shelf of the State of Paraíba: Bioclastic Sand with Granules and Gravel; Bioclastic Gravel and Bioclastic Sand. The facies characterization of continental shelf sediments, is important not only for a better understanding the shelf environment, reflecting past and current geological and hydrodynamic processes, but also for conservation, management, and assessment of environmental impacts, as preconized by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14–Life Below Water."

    "title": "Modeling of Intraplate Basaltic Magma Crystallization and the Evaluation of the Influence of Metamorphism on Rock Composition: The Anyui Gabbro-Dolerite Complex, Western Chukotka",
    "abstract": "Abstract The petrography, mineralogy and geochemistry of metamorphosed Permian–Triassic to Early Triassic rocks of the Anyui gabbro-dolerite complex, composing sills in metaterrigenous rocks of the Keperveem and Malyi Anyui uplifts of western Chukotka, were studied to determine the composition of the parental melt of these rocks and to assess the mobility of elements during their metamorphism. To solve these problems, the methods of petrological and geochemical modeling of melt crystallization were applied using the COMAGMAT version 3.72 program. It was established that the rocks (hypabyssal gabbros, gabbrodiorites, and diorites) are derivatives of a single parental melt formed in a large lower crustal magma chamber. These rocks are shown to have crystallized from intraplate continental tholeiitic basaltic parental melt that had a moderately differentiated composition with Mg# 52.1 corresponding to the Cpx–Pl cotectic and exhibited signals of crustal contamination. During regional metamorphism to the greenschist facies, the contents of a number of major, minor, and trace elements in the most of the studied rocks have been changed, with the estimated relative mobility of elements increasing as follows: Eu, V < Mn < Zn, U, Co < Cu, Pb < Sr < Fe, Ba, K, Rb < Ni < Cs < Mg < Ca, Na < Li. The elements immobile during metamorphism were Si, Al, Ti, P, REE (except Eu), Y, Sc, Nb, Ta, and probably also Zr, Hf, and Th (although the contents of the latter in some rocks may reflect the presence of xenogenic accessory minerals). The COMAGMAT program was applied to model the phase crystallization sequence established based on petrographic and mineralogical data on rocks, and the parameters of the compositions of the coexisting minerals during the fractionation stages of the parental melt before magnetite started to crystallize. The application of the petrological–geochemical modeling method in combination with data on the geochemistry and mineralogy of the gabbroids thus allows one to evaluate not only the compositions of the magmas and melts and their changes during fractionation but also an input/output of elements during metamorphism and the degree of their mobility."

    "title": "Carbon Behavior and Formation of Water Chemical Composition in the Drainage System of the Drained Eutrophic Peatland",
    "abstract": "Abstract Peatlands are recognized as one of the most critical ecosystems for long-term carbon sequestration, although they cover approximately 3% of the Earth’s surface. However, the drainage and peat extraction significantly disrupt the carbon balance of peatlands. Specifically, the drainage network, an integral component of drained peatlands, contributes substantially to greenhouse gas emissions and lateral carbon transport. In eutrophic peatlands, the drainage system also serves as a source of nutrients for receiving water bodies. To predict changes in the carbon balance, to develop effective reclamation efforts, and to implement climate-related projects, it is essential to understand the processes governing the chemical composition of drainage waters. In this study, we examined the chemical composition of drainage water in the eutrophic Tarmanskoe Peatland (West Siberia) using historical and contemporary data. Seasonal dynamics of dissolved carbon and fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) to the atmosphere were analyzed for 2024. Obtained results have revealed an increasing role of evaporation in the formation of water composition since launching the drainage system. This trend is expressed in an increase in chloride and sodium ion ratios, along with shifts in the water–rock equilibrium from kaolinite towards montmorillonite and carbonates. The equilibria in the carbonate system and the ratios of major ions indicate that carbon redistribution occurs through the dissolution and precipitation of carbonates during the drainage system’s operation. Seasonal dynamics of dissolved carbon and carbon-bearing greenhouse gas fluxes revealed distinct patterns. In summer, CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from water surface of the drainage ditches increased, while CO 2 emissions from the pond decreased due to the activity of photosynthetic organisms. Notably, a dry drainage ditch exhibited unique dynamics: summer CO 2 fluxes from its oversaturated bottom sediments decreased more than fivefold, and CH 4 fluxes remained near zero, comparable to spring levels. Meanwhile, both CH 4 and CO 2 are accumulated in the pore waters in dissolved forms. The results emphasize the importance of studying the carbon biogeochemistry in waterlogged soils and bottom sediments and the factors driving CO 2 and CH 4 accumulation in pore waters. These findings provide critical insights for developing novel approaches to the reclamation and implementation of climate-related projects for drained peatlands."

    "title": "Diverse Lavas of the Tigilsky Dol and Mount Oxi Massif (Sredinny Range, Kamchatka): a Perspective from the New Sr–Nd Isotope Data",
    "abstract": "Abstract Unique compositional diversity of volcanic rocks was recently discovered in an active fault zone of the Sredinny Range (Kamchatka) located in the zone of monogenetic volcanism near the Tigil and Oxi volcanoes. The lavas in the zone represent common for SR medium-K, high-K and high-Ti, and also unique for Kamchatka high-LREE and high-Mg varieties. In this contribution, we present new Sr-Nd isotope data for a representative set of lava samples from this area. The isotopic and geochemical characteristics of the majority of selected samples can be explained by the differences in the amount of fluid, fluid sources and melting conditions, proposed earlier for the SR. The high-LREE picritic basalts, however, differ significantly from the other Kamchatka volcanic rocks—their highly unusual high-LREE, high-Li and low-LILE geochemical characteristics combine with the highest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0.70365) and second-highest εNd (9.9) values ever reported for lavas from the SR. We suggest that they represent the product of melting of the specific SR lithosphere domain that has been metasomatized by melts derived from a strongly degassed slab."

    "title": "Physico-Chemical Mechanisms of Formation of Concentrically Banded Agates in Basalts: Hypotheses and Experiments",
    "abstract": "Abstract Based on literature data, the main properties of agates and the conditions of their formation are summarized, and a critical analysis of the hypotheses of agate formation is performed. The hypothesis of layerwise precipitation and crystallization of silica extracted from the host rock (in particular, basalt) turned out to be the most adequate. However, difficulties remained in explaining the SiO 2 movement from the host basalt to the agate cavities, the causes of SiO 2 precipitation, the role of phase transformations, and the mechanism of banding formation. To clarify these questions, experiments were performed on the dissolution of basalt samples in water for 4 months at 300°C. The formation of silica was noticeable only in experiments where the basalt sample was half-submerged in water. In particular, amorphous silica (opal-A) was precipitated in the pores and on the sample surface above the water level, which formed agate-like layered textures and was replaced in places by chalcedony. The experimental results are explained within the framework of the distillation hypothesis, which may be suitable for the formation of agates. The hypothesis combines the possibilities of SiO 2 transfer in low-concentration regions and its precipitation in high-concentration regions, and also explains the agate banding by fluctuations in supply and consumption of dissolved silica in precipitation and phase transformation reactions."

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport mechanisms of the intertidal mudflat-channel system is crucial for predicting its future survival and development. This study focuses on the Xiaoyangkou tidal flat in Rudong, located in the central part of Jiangsu Province, as a representative open-coast macrotidal mudflat. Field observations were conducted on the tidal mudflat-channel system during tidal cycles. The results show that wind waves generated by winds of approximately 7 m/s over a fetch length of 5 km can cause significant erosion on the mudflats during neap tides. However, under mild wind conditions, wind waves do not induce erosion on the thalweg within tidal channels or the lower parts of the banks. The peak flow velocity during both flood and ebb tides within the tidal channels occurs below the bankfull depth. Three distinct types of erosion processes were observed on the channel slopes: (1) Small-scale erosion on slopes less than 10 cm in width and 5 cm in depth, which leads to the widening and deepening of small tidal gullies and results in vertical erosion of the slopes. (2) Medium-sized tidal creeks, with widths of 10–100 cm and depths of 5–100 cm, experiencing sliding erosion. (3) Large tidal channels, with widths greater than 200 cm and depths exceeding 100 cm, are more prone to toppling collapse. Continuous wave action caused by wind oscillations below the bankfull depth at the observed cross-section of the tidal channels may be the primary driver of bank erosion."

    "title": "A New Reaction Controlling the Composition of Oils: Hydrogenation of Aromatic Hydrocarbons",
    "abstract": "Abstract Analysis of the composition of n -alkyl-substituted monocyclic compounds ( n -alkylcyclohexanes, n -alkylcyclopentanes, and n -alkylbenzenes) of Tatarstan oils made it possible to prove that the composition of the oils was controlled by still another reaction, whose evidence has never before been identified in rocks: the hydrogenation reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons. It has been directly proven that n -alkylcyclohexanes of the oils were partially formed from n -alkylbenzenes of these oils. Therewith catalysts for the hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons known in organic chemistry either are not present in any noticeable quantities in oils (as are platinum-group metals in the Earth’s crust) or are inactive in natural environments, and hence, it is not possible to indicate any natural catalyst for this reaction. Thus, the discovery of this reaction demonstrates the incompleteness of our understanding of the catalysts involved in the formation of the composition of oils. Literature data indicate that Tatarstan is not the only region in whose oils this reaction occurs. It is demonstrated that the oils should have occurred during their hydrogenation under conditions radically different from those that occurred during the formation of their main components (acid catalysts occurring during the first stage and absent during the second one). It follows that the hydrogenation reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons in Tatarstan oils operated during the later stages of their evolution, when the main composition of the oils had already been formed. It seems to be reasonable to assume that hydrogenation took place after the migration of oil from the source rock, i.e., this reaction operated either during oil migration routes or in the reservoir."

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents experimental results on the evaporation of the main types (A and B) of Ca–Al inclusions of chondrites in a Knudsen tungsten cell in the temperature range of 1000–2400°C. A peculiarity of the evaporation of the inclusions is that the silicon component is preserved in the residual melt to high temperatures exceeding 2200°C. At the same time, magnesium oxide completely evaporates from the melt, which leads to a decrease in the spinel content and even its disappearance during the crystallization of the residual melt at 2000°C. Magnesium evaporation leads, in turn, to an increase in the Al 2 O 3 content in the melt and, accordingly, to an increase in the content of gehlenite in melilite during its crystallization, as is observed in the high-temperature rims of subtype B1 inclusions. Experiments have also shown that the high-temperature evaporation of Ca–Al inclusions occurs in an oxygen-rich atmosphere compared to carbonaceous chondrite matter. In this regard, it is assumed that the condensation of the first mineral products of the inclusions occurred in the oxygen-rich atmosphere of the star (O-rich AGB) outside the protosolar system."

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic carbon content combined with organic carbon isotope composition have been applied for the study of organic matter transformation in marine sediments during upward gas migration at seep areas of the Laptev Sea. Organic matter extracted from marine sediments was separated into five fractions (hexane, hexane-benzene, benzene, benzene-methanol, asphaltenes) using solvents of increasing polarity. It has been shown that in the seep the destruction of asphaltenes fractions leads to enrichment of benzene-methanol fraction by isotope-light components. δ 13 C values of benzene-methanol fractions were much lower than δ 13 C values of asphaltenes fractions and were associated with the accumulation of bacterial biomass in the sediment core through which the upward methane flow was passed. The organic matter of seep area sediment cores can be classified by two clusters, according to δ 13 C values of benzene fractions of organic matter. The first cluster center was in the surface layer (about 10 cm) of marine sediments. The second cluster center was in a deeper sediment layer. The difference in carbon isotope composition between the cluster centers was 2–3‰. The use of carbon isotope type-curves for different horizons of a sediment core has enabled a better understanding of the biological effects related to upward gas migration in seep areas of the Arctic Seas."

    "title": "Bitumens in the Mir Kimberlite Pipe (Yakutia)",
    "abstract": "Abstract Solid bitumens in the Mir kimberlite pipe form vein-like segregations several centimeters in size. They are distributed irregularly in the pipe body, regardless of the kimberlite breccia varieties distribution. The bitumen content in the kimberlites ranges from 0.001 to 0.12 wt %. Bitumen-rich areas are confined to the pipe contacts and faults. The question of the origin of bitumens in kimberlites is hotly debated. Therefore, this work is aimed at determining their origin in the Mir pipe. The studied bitumen-bearing kimberlite samples were collected in the Mir pipe, from depths of 100 and 130 m. The chloroform bitumoid was extracted from bitumen. The carbon isotope compositions of bitumoids were determined, and biomarker analysis was carried out by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Biomarker hydrocarbons were detected in the bitumoid, indicating a biogenic origin of the organic matter. The following biomarkers were identified: n -alkanes, isoprenoids Pr and Ph, tri- and pentacyclic terpanes–hopanes, and steranes. The pristane to phytane ratio Pr/Ph = 0.8 indicates reducing conditions of formation corresponding to marine environment. The oddness ratio of n -alkanes, sterane and hopane maturity indices show that the thermal maturity of organic matter (OM) corresponds to the initial stage of the oil formation. The low content of long-chain alkanes and the predominance of C29 over C27 among regular steranes (C29/C27 = 2.2) allow us to assume that the initial biota for the OM of the bitumen sample under study could be phytoplankton. The δ 13 C VPDB values of the studied bitumoid (from –29.4 to –31.6‰) correspond to the isotopic compositions of bitumoids in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments of the Siberian Platform (from –25.8 to –33.8‰) and differ significantly from the isotopic composition of endogenous carbon (from –2 to –10‰). According to these features, the investigated bitumen from the Mir pipe is of marine origin."

    "title": "History of Iron Accumulation in the Precambrian and Phanerozoic",
    "abstract": "Abstract Iron ores are mostly typical supergene mineralized rocks whose origins were controlled by various tectonic, paleogeographic, and biochemical factors. Mineralogical and petrographic analysis of iron ore types shows that the most widely spread and abundant Precambrian and Phanerozoic types are banded iron formations (BIF), oolitic hydrogoethite–chamosite–siderite (Lorraine type), and hematite and goethite–hydrogoethite weathering crusts (WC). The other types of the ores do not play any significant role in the resources, and their amount is at the level of the statistical error. The Earth’s history was associated with a clearly discernible evolution in the character of iron accumulation. The trend was pulsating, with several stages of ore accumulation. The accumulation of iron ores was confined to greenstone belts in the Archean, to protoplatforms in the Paleoproterozoic, to rift basins in the Neoproterozoic, and to platforms in the Phanerozoic. The Archean and Paleoproterozoic ores are BIF, the Neoproterozoic ones belong to the granular iron formation, and the Phanerozoic are the WC and oolitic formations. The mineralogical–petrographic types of ores also evolved with time. While hematite–magnetite ores are typical of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic; hematite ores are typical of the Neoproterozoic; and hematite, hydrohematite, goethite WC, and oolitic hematite–chamosite–siderite ores are characteristic of the Phanerozoic. The change in ore types was controlled by changes in the facies conditions and by metamorphic processes in the Precambrian."

    "abstract": "Abstract Zircon U–Pb dating of the Penggongmiao granite batholith in the western part of Cathaysia block, Hunan Province, South China, together with Hf isotopes and whole-rock elemental analyses, reveal critical insights into its depositional history. Zircon U–Pb geochronology traces the primary crystallization phase to between 445.3 ± 2.0 and 440.5 ± 1.9 Ma. An earlier onset indicated by 464.1 ± 0.9 Ma for fine- and medium-grained porphyritic granodiorite, suggests emplacement began before the Middle Ordovician. Geochemically, the rocks exhibit a calc-alkaline, ferruginous, and peraluminous composition, characterized by K 2 O + Na 2 O content of 6.46–8.32 wt %, Mg # values of 21–42, and A/CNK ratios of 1.11–1.31. High ε Hf (t) values ranging from –7.50 to –4.20, with T DM2 ages of 1.54–1.73 Ga, point to magma derived predominantly from sedimentary sources, with strongly mantle contributions. Major and trace element data indicate that the batholith formed in a post-orogenic extensional setting during a transition from compressional orogeny to non-orogenic conditions. The evidence suggests that formation was the likely result of asthenospheric mantle upwelling due to the rollback of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks during subduction. This tectonic process caused partial melting of the lithospheric mantle and overlying ancient crustal material, producing a granite of mixed crust-mantle origin dominated by crustal sources."

Through the comparison with the detrital zircon ages of adjacent terranes, the detrital zircons of the Riwanchaka Formation are considered to come from the underlying magmatic rocks of the Wangguoshan Formation. The sandstone petrology and cumulative proportion age of detrital zircons indicate that the source tectonic setting of the Riwanchaka Formation is a convergent island arc. The rapidly accumulating sandstone, coral with low differentiation, the limestone breccia, slump limestone, and slump sandstone of the slope facies all further suggest that the Riwanchaka Formation has been accumulated within an isolated basin flanked by an intra-oceanic volcanic arc. Based on the similarity of the age distribution patterns and Th/U ratios of detrital zircons, this research infers that the Maoershan metamorphic rocks are sourced from the intra-oceanic arc composed of the Riwanchaka Formation and the Wangguoshan Formation. This provides important evidence for the existence of the Longmu Co-Shuanghu Paleo-Tethys Ocean and confirms that the subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean in the Early Carboniferous was intra-oceanic subduction."

    "title": "Compositional Evolution of Calzirtite and Perovskite in Phoscorites and Carbonatites of the Guli Alkaline–Ultramafic Complex, Polar Siberia",
    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents data on the composition and phase heterogeneity of calzirtite Ca 2 Zr 5 Ti 2 O 16 and perovskite CaTiO 3 , which are HFSE oxides that crystallized during the early stages of formation of the carbonatite rock series of the Guli alkaline–ultramafic complex in Polar Siberia. The composition of HFSE minerals systematically changed during the evolution of the carbonatite melt from phoscorites to carbonatites. The calzirtite enriched up to 6 wt % Nb 2 O 5 , and the perovskite enriched up to 15 wt % Nb 2 O 5 , 7.7 wt % ZrO 2 , and 6 wt % LREE 2 O 3 in the phoscorites and early calcite carbonatites. Perovskite with low concentrations of admixtures crystallized in the late calcite carbonatites in association with U-, Th-, Ta-rich fluorcalciopyrochlore, thorianite, zirconolite, and baddeleyite. The composition of perovskite-group minerals evolved according to the following of isomorphic exchange schemes: Nb 5+ + Fe 3+ ↔ Ti 4+ + Zr 4+ and 2Ca 2+ ↔ Na + + REE 3+ . The enrichment of the early calzirtite and perovskite generations in HFSE is explained by the high Nb, Zr, and LREE partition coefficients in carbonatite melt–mineral equilibria. During the crystallization of the carbonatite melt, the activity of alkaline elements decreased, which is confirmed by a decrease in sodium content in the perovskite and a change in the composition of the solid inclusions. The early generations of perovskite and calzirtite from the phoscorites commonly host numerous polyphase inclusions of Ca, Na, K, Ba, and Sr carbonates, halides, and alkali metal sulfides, whereas calcite, fluorapatite, pyrophanite, and barite are found in the late generations of these minerals. It is shown that the crystallization of the phoscorites have crystallized from anhydrous melt that contained no water, and this was favorable for the preservation of alkaline carbonates as solid inclusions in minerals."

    "abstract": "Abstract The problem of elemental background variation greatly influences anomaly recognition and has not been effectively addressed. Taking the 1 : 200 000 scale geochemical data of stream sediments from Leiyang, SE China, as an example, we established a Random Forests model to determine Sn anomalies, focusing on the application effect of this method. Al 2 O 3 , CaO, K 2 O, MgO, Na 2 O, SiO 2 , Ba, Be, Li, and Y were selected as model indicators, and 40 background and 40 anomalous samples were chosen to train the Random Forests model, which was then used to estimate the probability (0 to 1) of Sn mineralization. According to the identification rate of known Sn deposits in the study area, the high, medium, and low Sn mineralization probability thresholds were determined to be 1, 0.98, and 0.96, respectively, and thus, strong, medium, and weak Sn anomalies were delineated. Compared to the Sn anomalies identified using the [mean ± k standard deviation] method and the partitioning method, those determined by Random Forests exhibit greater accuracy. Random Forests eliminated some spurious anomalies that are easily misidentified in high-background areas and better recognized some subtle anomalies that are challenging to detect in low-background areas, suggesting that it can largely remove the background influence on the identification of geochemical anomalies."

    "title": "Elemental Composition and Sources of Urban Dust of a Large Industrial City (Krasnoyarsk, Russia)",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports the first comprehensive study of urban dust from Krasnoyarsk. The elemental composition of the dust was determined, and several natural and anthropogenic sources of its formation were distinguished. Dust samples ( n = 68) were collected in different functional regions of the city. The contents of 70 elements were measured in the dust samples. The (CaO + Na 2 O)–Al 2 O 3 –K 2 O and (CaO + Na 2 O + K 2 O)–Al 2 O 3 –(Fe 2 O 3 + MgO) diagrams showed that the mineral component of most of the Krasnoyarsk dust samples is dominated by plagioclases. The calculation of enrichment factors and geoaccumulation indices showed that the Krasnoyarsk dust is enriched by Co, Sn, Ni, Pb, Mo, Cu, As, Zn, Cd, W, Ag, and Sb. The characteristics of trace element accumulation depending on sampling locality were evaluated. Antimony is accumulated mainly in samples from major highways of Krasnoyarsk, whereas elevated As, Cu, W, and Zn contents were usually found in samples collected in industrial zones of the city. Using principal component analysis and the Pearson correlation matrix, six groups of elements were distinguished in the dust samples, and their natural and anthropogenic sources were determined: Al, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni were supplied by soil and rock weathering; Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and As, emissions from metallurgical plants and coal-burning thermal power plants; W, Bi, Zn, and Mo, heavy metallurgical and mechanical engineering industries; Cu, Cd, Sn, and Pb, emissions of motor and rail transport, as well as wear of metal parts and structures; Sn and Sb, wear of brake pads and tires and industrial emissions; and Hg, soil and rock weathering."

The paper presents the first data on the mineral associations of the miaskite varieties and REE-rich minerals. Microchemical studies determined that the pyroxene–amphibole miaskites are the most promising rock variety for REE mineralization (REE content at ca. 1500 ppm). These rocks show clearly discernible positive Nb anomalies combined with a negative Pb anomaly. The temperatures of feldspar exsolution indicate their following formation sequence within the miaskite varieties (from higher temperature to lower temperature ones): pyroxene–amphibole miaskite → garnet–amphibole miaskite → amphibole miaskite → biotite miaskite"

    "abstract": "Abstract In the Bug granulite-gneiss domain of the Ukrainian shield, a composite tectono-magmatic breccia including enderbites and various mafic rocks was studied in the gneiss-enderbite complex. Based on the assessment of the thermodynamic conditions of rock and mineral formation and the analysis of the U–Pb and Lu–Hf isotope systems of zircon, the endogenous history of the gneiss–enderbite complex is deciphered. The predominant rocks are enderbites with numerous enclaves of two-pyroxene and pyroxene–amphibole crystalline schists that were deformed under granulite facies metamorphism. The oldest zircons have a concordant U–Pb age of 3.6–3.7 Ga, which is close to the age of the protolith of the Bug enderbites. The zircons are characterized by a heterogeneous structure, negative ɛHf(t) values from –1 to –38, and a variation in 176 Hf/ 177 Hf (0) isotope ratios from 0.28035 to 0.28095, which is consistent with their different ages and origins. Based on the age, geochemistry, and isotope composition of zircon from composite breccia rocks, following geological events from Archean to Proterozoic are distinguished: (1) 3.67–3.60 Ga stage of magmatic crystallization of early mineral associations; (2) 3.0‒2.8 Ga stage of granulite metamorphism and partial melting (2.9 Ga) of the enderbites with the preservation of melt mineral phases in zircons, but with a strong disturbance of its U–Pb isotope system; (3) 2.0–1.9 Ga stage of Proterozoic granulite metamorphism with the reorganization of cation and isotope systems of rock-forming and accessory minerals. The obtained data are consistent with the model of polychronous evolution of the continental crust of the Ukrainian Shield in the Paleo- and Mesoarchean with its strong reworking in the Paleoproterozoic."

    "abstract": "Abstract Experience in using our previous equation for the prediction of water solubility in silicate melt revealed that the calculated water contents for some experiments at pressures of 5–20 kbar are unrealistically high compared with the experimental measurements. The sample containing the results of 412 experiments used in the previous study was significantly expanded by adding experiments from the MELT database. Using the new total sample containing 1241 experiments, the set of variables describing the effect of melt composition on water solubility was revised. The newly calibrated equation predicts water solubility in silicate melts with an uncertainty of no higher than ±0.01 mole fraction or ±0.25 wt % at pressures from one atmosphere to 20 kbar and temperatures from 825 to 1550 K. The sample size used for the optimization allows the equation to be applied over a wide range of silicate melt composition from komatiitic basalt to rhyolite."

    "title": "Neon as a Criterion for Noble Gas Distribution between Gas Accumulations and Edgewater",
    "abstract": "Abstract The relationships of Ne isotopic composition with Ne and N 2 partial pressures and N 2 /Ne ratio in gas accumulations was analyzed for the first time. The influence of groundwater on the contents and isotopic compositions of noble gases in CO 2 , N 2 , and CH 4 gas reservoirs was also evaluated. It was shown that Ne partial pressure in different gas accumulations increases in the sequence CO 2 –CH 4 –N 2 . Neon with the mantle isotope signature is typical of CO 2 accumulations, whereas N 2 accumulations are dominated by a mixture of atmospheric and crustal Ne ( 20 Ne/ 22 Ne is 8.9–10.2, and 21 Ne/ 22 Ne is 0.040–0.083). The initial concentration and isotopic composition of Ne and certainly other noble gases depend on the formation conditions of the gas phase that enters the reservoir. Subsequently, Ne partial pressure increases in the CO 2 and CH 4 gas accumulations but decreases in the N 2 gas accumulations, supposedly owing to gas exchange with groundwater. We proposed a model for gas exchange between a gas reservoir and groundwater, which allowed us to estimate the distribution of noble gases between them. (1) CO 2 entering reservoirs has a negligible partial pressure of mantle Ne (∼0.008 Pa). Therefore, the fraction of Ne from groundwater in them may be as high as 90%. (2) In contrast, N 2 reservoirs have the atmospheric Ne isotopic signature with an admixture of a nucleogenic (crustal) component and Ne partial pressure higher than in the atmosphere. The N 2 gas phase was most likely derived from ancient Ca–Cl brines under a formation pressure of less than 300 bar. (3) The isotopic composition of Ne from CH 4 reservoirs is consistent with the assumption that microbial CH 4 is formed under near-surface conditions (atmospheric gases dominate), and thermogenic CH 4 is formed at greater depths. Neon and N 2 in thermogenic CH 4 was probably produced by gas exchange with Ca–Cl brines. In general, the isotopic composition of Ne in CH 4 reservoirs reflects the mixing of microbial and thermogenic CH 4 during migration to the surface."

    "title": "Composition and Genesis of Organic Matter in Soils and Bottom Sediments of the Residential Zone of Khabarovsk",
    "abstract": "Abstract — Data are presented on the distribution and composition of organic abiotic (TOC, HC, and C HC /TOC, %) and biotic (phytopigments and microbial communities) components of soils and bottom sediments (BS) that formed during long-term anthropogenic transformation of the landscape. Average concentrations of TOC in the soils and bottom sediments did not significantly differ and varied at the level of 4.9%. HC content was 20–560 mg/kg in the soils and 3–20 mg/kg in BS. The BS contain 1.4–6.0 μg/g chlorophyll (chl.) a , up to 2.8 μg/g chl. b , and up to 3.9 μg/g chl. c . The soil contains no more than 4.4 μg/g chl. a , 2.8 μg/g chl. b , and 3.9 μg/g chl. c . Carotenoids dominated among the phytopigments, and their concentrations varied from 6.8 to 12.2 μg/g in the sediments and from 4.1 to 9.5 μg/g in the soils. The fraction of primary-production carbon in TOC was 0.01 to 1.36% in the river sediments and 0.18 to 0.76% in the soils, which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the fraction of HC. Diatoms were found out to actively participate in the production of organic matter (OM) in the river sediments. Using molecular markers, a more significant role of the primary production of microalgae than higher vegetation was identified in the formation of organic matter in the soils and BS. A leading role in the formation of OM in soils and sediments belongs to the microbial-destructive component (∑C 20 –C 25 = 33.9–48.2%), which is consistent with the relatively high (up to 63.6%) fraction of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria in the microbial communities. It has been shown that during secondary soil formation on ash dumps, a significant role in the formation of organic matter is played by microalgae: the proportion of the corresponding markers (∑C 15 , C 17 , and C 19 ) reached 42.6% of the total n -alkanes."

The distribution of total organic carbon over the study area is shown. Samples were analysed by Rock-Eval analytical pyrolysis, 13 C isotope analysis and chromatography-mass spectrometry. The organic matter composition included hopanoids similar to those found in the 2011 expedition samples taken from the first discovered mega-seepage area. The hopanoids detected are thought to be derived from the activity of methanotrophic microorganisms. The peculiar distribution of n -alkanes, hopanoids and traces of steranes found in samples confined to rift zones may indicate the migration of petroleum fluids."

    "abstract": "Abstract — The paper presents the first data on individual fluid inclusions hosted in quartz in the ores of three types (polysulfide, gold–silver–telluride, and gold–bismuth) of the Spokoininsky ore cluster with gold ore mineralization. The three ore types show differences in the physicochemical parameters and composition of their fluids. The fluid of the Spokoininsky cluster polysulfide ores are characterized by a relatively low initial temperature (180‒350°C), a higher CO 2 density (0.27‒0.71 g/cm 3 ), and a higher fluid pressure (0.7‒1 kbar) compared to the fluids that formed the gold–silver–telluride ores (temperature 200–260°C, CO 2 density 0.28–0.56 g/cm 3 , pressure 0.7 kbar). The dominant salts in the fluids of polysulfide ores are Na and Mg chlorides, whereas the mineral-forming fluids of the gold–silver–telluride ores are simpler saline aqueous fluids containing Na chlorides. The fluids that formed the polysulfide ores have a H 2 O–CO 2 –N 2 composition, whereas the fluid of the gold–silver–telluride ores is mostly of H 2 O–CO 2 composition. The gold–bismuth ores in the Mayskoe ore field were formed by H 2 O–CO 2 -bearing fluids with a salinity concentration of 4.0‒6.4 wt %-equiv. NaCl, a CO 2 density of 0.56‒0.61 g/cm 3 , at a temperature of 280‒335°C and a pressure of 0.7 kbar. The data led us to conclude that the ore-forming fluid of the Spokoininsky ore cluster was similar to the fluids of orogenic gold deposits."

    "title": "Dissolved Molybdenum, Tungsten, and Vanadium at the Oxic–Anoxic Interface in the Black Sea",
    "abstract": "Abstract The distribution of dissolved molybdenum, tungsten, and vanadium was investigated in the northeastern part of the Black Sea down to a depth of 320 m. The depth of hydrogen sulfide appearance (the onset of the anaerobic zone) in the studied area was about 165 m (at a potential density of ∼16.2 kg m –3 ). Water samples with dissolved (<0.45 μm) species and dissolved plus labile particulate species of the elements were collected in July 2016 and 2017. The concentration of dissolved Mo increased with depth in the oxic zone, from 36 to 39 nmol/kg, and showed no difference from the sum of dissolved and particulate forms. In the anoxic zone, molybdenum decreased when the hydrogen sulfide concentration exceeded ∼8 μM and reached 3.3 nmol/kg at 320 m. The tungsten concentration decreased from 160 pmol/kg at the surface to 113 pmol/kg at the redox interface (in the suboxic layer at depth 150 m) in the presence of particulate manganese. As Mn oxyhydroxides dissolved in the hydrogen sulfide zone, W concentrations increased to 221 pmol/kg at a depth of 180 m, along with an increase in dissolved Mn. The distribution of W at the redox interface is controlled by the sorption properties of Mn oxide. Dissolved vanadium was depleted at a depth of 5 m and increased with depth in the oxic zone to 13 nmol/kg, with a decrease in the suboxic zone (down to 7.1 nmol/kg). In the anoxic zone, a maximum of V concentration (up to 15.2 nmol/kg) was observed, coinciding with the maximum of dissolved Mn. The calculated balance of Mo and V in the Black Sea showed that about 1200 t of Mo and 1200 t of V are annually buried in the sediments. Tungsten is thought to be supplied in significant amounts to the Black Sea in the form of suspended and colloidal matter in riverine waters, and this matter passes then into seawater in the process of suboxic diagenesis in sediments."

    "abstract": "Abstract The kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in the sedimentary cover of a subducting plate was numerically simulated using published estimates for the temperature of the subducting plate surface, subsidence rate, and the kinetic spectrum of aquatic organic matter. It was shown that the peak oil window occurs in a subduction environment at depths of 12.6–23.3 km and temperatures of 147.6–179.4°C and requires 0.1–6.4 million years. The scatter in the estimates of depth, temperature, and time required to reach the peak oil window is related to variations in subduction angle and velocity and temperature gradient in the published models. The estimates of depths and temperatures for the formation of hydrocarbons in the sedimentary cover of a subducting plate are higher than those for Cenozoic, Mesozoic, and Paleozoic sedimentary basins, whereas the time required for oil formation is shorter. It can be suggested that accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons could hardly be produced by the organic matter of the sedimentary cover of a subduction plate, but there are prospects for the formation of dry gas fields."

Using the enrichment indices for the soil and ground cover of the Pioneer deposit territory, the following pollutant elements were determined: As, Sb, Mo, Bi, W, S, Cd, and Pb. Using the methods of mathematical statistics, the background contents of As, Sb, Bi, Mo, W, S, Cd, and Pb in the technogenically transformed territory at the sampling time accounted for 63, 8.84, 0.69, 3.54, 4.19, 529, 0.11, and 36.5 mg/kg, respectively. The exceedance of background values for As, Sb, Bi, Mo, W, and S is caused by the natural metallogenic features of the territory. It has been established that the sources of metal emissions into the environment are mining facilities and structures of the mining complex: quarries, waste dumps, heap leaching areas, gold extraction plant, and tailings dumps."

    "abstract": "Abstract CaSiO 3 inclusions in diamonds from the Juina area in Brazil have low Fe (0.08–0.53 wt % FeO) and Al (0–1.52 wt % Al 2 O 3 ) concentrations; they belong to the ultramafic association. Two different types exist among CaSiO 3 grains. Type I has a normal REE n pattern, while type II has a sinusoidal REE n pattern. Type I CaSiO 3 associates with high-Mg–high-Ni protogenetic ferropericlase, and type II associates with high-Fe–low-Ni syngenetic ferropericlase. Thus, type I CaSiO 3 grains are protogenetic, formed, like high-Mg–high-Ni ferropericlase, in the upper part of the lower mantle as davemaoite (CaSi-perovskite), and type II CaSiO 3 were formed in the transition zone as breyite. The enrichment of CaSiO 3 in REE, particularly in LREE, corresponds to high values of their partition coefficient CaSiO 3 /melt and shows the CaSiO 3 ’s origin from a mantle material under high pressures. The isotope characteristics of the studied CaSiO 3 demonstrate strong geochemical heterogeneity in the inclusions. The 87 Rb/ 86 Sr ratios in type II CaSiO 3 (0.127–3.23) are 3–4 orders higher than in type I (0.0008). Even within a single diamond, different CaSiO 3 grains have 87 Rb/ 86 Sr ratios varying from 0.014 to 3.23. The same is true for U/Pb isotope systematics (e.g., 238 U/ 206 Pb varies in one sample in an order of magnitude from 0.031 to 0.312) and, to some extent, for Sm/Nd ratios. This implies the geochemical heterogeneity in Deep Earth on a very small scale."

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents analysis of the crystal morphology of two similarly shaped interpenetration twins of cubic crystals: the Chinese Lantern diamond (Arkhangelsk diamond mining province, provided for this study by courtesy of the ALROSA company) and a diamond crystal from Brazil, which has been studied in much detail by A.E. Fersman. Comparison of data on these diamonds, which were obtained using original methodological techniques for interpreting morphological indications of crystal growth and dissolution, revealed a number of crystal morphological features of crystals characteristic of regular accretions of this type. In addition to tetragonal pits characteristic of the cuboids, ribbon-shaped, jagged, and drop-shaped relief features typical of surface dissolution, a new type of symmetrical sawtooth microrelief associated with etching of octahedral layers of cuboid growth was discovered on the diamond from the Arkhangelsk province. In accordance with the height and direction of the steps of the relief pattern, the development sequence of the aforementioned types of microrelief is determined according to the increase in the depth of dissolution and the degree of change in the curvature of the surface of the tetrahexahedron on twin cuboids. The genesis of the characteristic equatorial sharp ridge of octahedron faces encircling the twinning plane was revealed. It is demonstrated to has been formed in relation to an early stage of the systematic coalescence of fibrous diamond cuboids and to be a determining condition of its development, first as a interpenetration twin of flat-faced octahedral crystals. Crystal morphological similarities between indications of dissolution on curved tetrahexahedra from kimberlites of the Arkhangelsk pipes and placer sources in Brazil and the north of the Yakutian diamond-bearing province is discussed."

    "title": "Assessment of Kinetic Conditions of Quartz Geothermometer Application: Experiment and Modeling",
    "abstract": "Abstract A quartz geothermometer ( QG ) makes it possible to determine the temperature of a deep geothermal reservoir ( GR ) using SiO 2 concentration ( m ) in a solution outflowing from this reservoir on the surface. An error made in the initial QG modeling led to the underestimation of the quartz precipitation rate and thus expanded the region of QG application. Another disadvantage of this modeling was that it ignored the possibility of precipitation of metastable silica modifications. To eliminate these shortcomings, a new numerical QG modeling was performed by the finite-difference method using new kinetic data. The reliability of data was assessed by their involvement in modeling the slow cooling of the quartz–water system and comparison of the obtained results with the experimental results of this process. The best agreement between the experiments and calculations was obtained using two-stage SiO 2 precipitation when different kinetic constants were applied above and below the amorphous silica ( AS ) solubility for the description of deposition of AS and other metastable silica modifications, respectively. The results of the new QG simulation using new kinetic data were similar at the same ratio of the two initial parameters that characterize the deposition surface area normalized to the water mass in the system ( S / M ) and the rate of solution rise ( v ). The real boundary values of this ratio, S / M and v , were determined, at which the model predicts the correct QG values for different temperatures of the solution in GR and at the surface. Kinetic equations used in the simulation ignore many peculiarities of the silica precipitation mechanism. An experimental study of these peculiarities will provide a more realistic QG model close to the real natural processes."

    "title": "Conditions during the Formation of Carbon-Bearing Rocks, Transonega Region",
    "abstract": "Abstract In order to determine the physico-chemical conditions for the formation of Precambrian сarbon-bearing rocks (CBR) of the Trans-Onega region, the compositions of their minerals and fluid inclusions (FI) in quartz were studied in samples collected at different mine workings of the Zazhogino ore field. The obtained FI density values in the rocks fluctuate in a sufficiently wide range. This indicates the existence of several stages of changes in the temperature regime of fluids during epigenesis. The densities and concentrations of FI solutions from the host silicified lydites are close to those of the highest-density varieties from quartz veinlets in the CBR. Some FI are partially decrepitated, which indicates superimposed processes in the post-capture period. Based on the studies of eutectic temperatures, it is suggested that mineral-forming solutions in the inclusions throughout the entire ore field contain magnesium chloride. The study of the chemical composition of the minerals of the CBR and host rocks allowed us to identify various sulfides, oxides, carbonates, phosphates, silicates, and aluminosilicates. Among them, mineral assemblages suitable for calculating the temperatures and pressures of mineral formation were selected and the corresponding calculations were carried out. Comparison of the results of the FI study and mineral thermobarometry allowed us to estimate the PT conditions that existed during the CBR epigenesis. The maximum values of the greenschist-facies temperatures and pressures during CBR formation correspond to T = 410–400°C and P = 2.4–2.1 kbar. Chlorites were formed at T = 240–200°C and P = 0.5–0.4."

    "title": "The Archean Age of Granite-Gneiss Complexes from the Kama–Vyatka Zone (the Volga-Ural Segment, East European Craton)",
    "abstract": "Abstract The formation history of granulite complexes is fundamental significance for understanding the growth of early continental crust. The work presents the results of an isotope-geochronological study of rock samples from the main lithotectonic complexes of the Kama–Vyatka zone (the Volga–Ural segment of the East European Craton)—enderbites of the Otradnenskaya Group and quartz diorites of the Tanaisky plagiogranitoid massif. The model ages of quartz diorites of the Tanaisky plagiogranitoid massif and enderbites of the Otradnenskaya Groups calculated from Sm–Nd data are 3.2 and 3.0 Ga, respectively. Zircons from the quartz diorites of the Tanaisky plagiogranitoid massif and the enderbites of the Otradnenskaya Group were dated by U–Pb LA-ICP-MS method. Zircon from quartz diorites yielded the Archean age of protolith of the plagiogranitoids of the Tanaisky Massif. This time interval of 3.04–2.98 Ga marks the stage of the oldest granulite metamorphism immediately following the magmatic event. Zircons from weakly gneissose enderbites of the Otradnenskaya Group is subdivided into two age groups: 3.0–2.8 and 2.750–2.60 Ga. Based on the morphology, internal structure of the crystals, and their isotope-geochemical characteristics (Th and U contents, Th/U ratio), each of the indicated age groups includes several zircon generations. Within a time interval of 3.0–2.8 Ga, the identified zircon generations record the following events: the formation of primary enderbites, local partial melting under the granulite-facies conditions, and retrograde metamorphism under transitional granulite–amphibolite facies. With allowance for the model age of the enderbites, the Otradnenskaya Group of the Kama–Vyatka zone of the Volga–Ural segment was dated for the first time at 3.0 ± 0.1 Ga. In the time interval of 2.75–2.60 Ga, zircon from weakly gneissose enderbites records the peak granulite metamorphism, which spanned the entire Volga-Ural segment, and subsequent retrograde metamorphism accompanying by the input of hydrous fluid and temperature decrease."

    "title": "Reconstructed Characteristics of the Initial Melt of the Kaalamo Multiphase Clinopyroxenite–Gabbronorite–Diorite Intrusion, Northern Ladoga Area, Southern Karelia",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Kaalamo early orogenic Paleoproterozoic massif is located in the southeastern part of the Raahe–Ladoga zone, a junction zone between the Archean Karelian craton and the Proterozoic Svecofennian orogen. The massif consists of three intrusive phases: the first phase is peridotites, olivine clinopyroxenites, and gabbro; the second one is gabbro-norites and gabbro-diorites; and the third phase is diorites, tonalites, and plagiogranites. The paper presents newly obtained data on the petrochemistry and geochemistry of metaperidotites, metapyroxenites, and gabbroids from the Kaalamo complex and on the compositions of their rock-forming minerals. These data were used in the COMAGMAT-3.75 program for thermodynamic calculations of the equilibrium crystallization trajectories of representative rocks and average compositions of the first and second intrusive phases. The calculation results were processed using the geochemical thermometry method, which made it possible to estimate the temperature (∼1220°C) and the probable composition of the initial high-Mg melt (∼9.5 wt % MgO, olivine with 84 mol % forsterite). Comparison of this primitive melt with the model compositions of derivatives and petro- and geochemical characteristics confirms that the rocks of the first and second intrusive phases were derived from a single source, which is consistent with the REE patterns of these rocks and data on their Sm–Nd isotope system and indicate that the rocks have a common mantle source. It was found out that the calculated crystallization sequences of the rocks are in good agreement with the abundance of peridotites and olivine pyroxenites, indicating that the primitive melt was in equilibrium with clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, which are in peritectic relationships with the olivine. The most differentiated rocks of the first phase are characterized by the crystallization of cotectic plagioclase containing about 80 mol % anorthite. The rocks of the second phase are more differentiated material, corresponding to the gabbronorite association of cumulus phases without olivine and with the late crystallization of titanomagnetite. Comparison of the model and real mineral compositions shows a systematic shift of the natural compositions of the olivine and pyroxenes toward the iron richer from early to late phases, which is a consequence of the interaction of the early cumulus minerals with residual intercumulus melt. The rocks are similar to intrusions of the nickel-bearing belt of Finland, which opens prospects for correlations of magmatic events on an interregional scale."

    "abstract": "Abstract The unique association of the epidote-group REE minerals, as well as the evolution of lanthanides and actinides, titanium and vanadium in their composition are described. Allanite-(Ce), often with a ferriallanite-(Ce) core, allanite-(Y) in an outer zone, and a rim of REE epidote forms pseudomorphs after chevkinite-(Ce) and perrierite-(Ce), as well as isolated crystals. They form intergrowths with biotite and are developed near it in quartz gabbronorite-dolerites and gabbronorite-diorites of the island-arc hypabyssal mafic Pervomaysk–Ayudag complex of the Middle Jurassic–Early Bajocian age in the Mountain Crimea. Zonal allanite-(Ce) of similar composition with REE epidote rims is widespread in the quartz diorites and plagiogranites of the same complex, where it is often developed in granophyric quartz–oligoclase intergrowths. Brown ferriallanite-(Ce) enriched in Ti (±Th) forms cores in brown allanite-(Ce) crystals enriched in Ti (±V) (up to 4.9 wt % TiO 2 ). The Ti-rich (up to 3.5 wt % TiO 2 ) allanite-(Ce) developed after ilmenite is extremely rich in vanadium (up to 4.5 wt % V 2 O 3 ). Light colored low-titanium allanite-(Ce) has grown on the titanium-enriched allanite-(Ce). The distribution of REE and yttrium in the allanite-(Ce) and ferriallanite-(Ce) is as follows: Ce > La > Nd > Y > Pr > Sm ∼ Dy ∼ Gd > Er ∼ Tb. The outer zones of allanite-(Ce) crystals and REE epidote are relatively enriched in Nd, with Nd > La in some of them. The yttrium and REE show peculiar relations in allanite-(Y): Y \\( \\gg \\) Ce ∼ Nd ∼ Dy ∼ Er > La ∼ Gd ∼ Yb. Allanite-(Ce) in the Crimean gabbroids is noticeably richer in La, Ti, V and poorer in Y, Sm, Gd in comparison with allanite-(Ce) in Crimean plagiogranitoids. The distribution of REE and yttrium in allanite-(Ce) of Crimean plagiogranitoids is close to that of common granites, differing in an increased proportion of Gd. The coloration reasons and sources of Crimean magmatic allanite are considered. Allanite was partially replaced by monazite-(Ce) during regional metamorphism under the prehnite-pumpellyite facies conditions."

    "abstract": "Abstract New data on the content of humic substances (HS) in the East Siberian Sea are presented. The results of the studies showed that the degree of humification of organic matter (OM) in the studied samples of the upper layer of bottom sediments of the sea varies from 21 to 9% and averages 15%, which is typical of the low-productivity Arctic seas. It was found that the average HS values (for the considered profiles) were 0.16 and 0.20%, which is typical of oxidized marine sediments. The concentration of organic carbon (C org ) varied from 0.34 to 1.89% depending on the granulometric type of sediment. It is shown that the total C org consists of 10–40% HS, and the HS themselves consist of 12–30% humic acids (HA) and 70–88% fulvic acids (FA), which indicates the early humification of sediments. НAs were determined only in the sediments of the coastal part of the sea. FAs were determined in all studied bottom sediments."

    "abstract": "Abstract The Aksu River region, located in East Kunlun, Xinjiang, is part of the Qin-Qi-Kun Orogenic System and the North Kunlun magmatic arc. The region hosts Late Triassic volcanic rocks of the Elashan Formation, primarily composed of andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. Geochemical analyses of these volcanic rocks are essential to deciphering the tectonic evolution of the region. This study investigates the geological characteristics, petrology, and geochemistry of the Elashan Formation to elucidate its tectonic setting and significance. The rocks display SiO 2 contents of 53.65–76.16%, total alkali contents of 4.77–6.05%, Rittmann index values of 0.86–3.2, and aluminum saturation indices (ASI) of 1.39–1.84, classifying them as predominantly calc-alkaline, ranging from metaluminous to peraluminous, and intermediate to acidic in composition. The total rare earth element (REE) content ranges from 101.05 to 215.77 ppm, with light-to-heavy REE ratios of 6.44–19.24, indicating significant REE fractionation and light REE enrichment (δEu = 0.53–1.05). The REE distribution patterns exhibit a rightward incline. Large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs) such as Rb, U, and K exhibit significant enrichment, while Nb, Ta, Sr, P, and Ti are relatively depleted, forming troughs in trace element distribution diagrams indicative of enrichment in strongly incompatible elements. Based on Rittmann, Pearce, and Harris diagrams, along with regional tectonic evolution and petrographic characteristics, the Elashan Formation volcanic rocks are interpreted to have formed in an active continental margin continental arc environment."

    "title": "Distinctive Features of Sedimentation in the Talaya Group of Glacial Lakes, Kolyma Highlands, during the Late Neopleistocene–Holocene: Geochemical Evidence",
    "abstract": "Abstract — The group of Talaya lakes in the eastern Maimandzhinsky Mountains, Kolyma Highlands, NE Russia, comprises Gryazevoe, Shchuch’e, Goluboe, and Nalimnoe lakes of glacial origin, which were formed in the Late Neopleistocene to Early Holocene. Geochemical characteristics were obtained from the lake sediments, tephra, deluvial deposits, and bedrocks. Based on the analysis of the distribution of major elements, the SiO 2 /TiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 /TiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 /MnO, SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 /MgO, and SiO 2 /Fe 2 O 3 ratios, the ICV and CIA indices, and on the analysis of principal-component data, geochemical zones reflecting various sedimentation conditions have been distinguished in the sediments: intervals of biogenic, terrigenous, and chemogenic (authigenic) accumulation. The authigenic iron-containing minerals are sulfides (pyrite and pyrrhotite), and the clastic minerals are titanomagnetite, magnetite, and ilmenite. Data obtained on the dependences of the ratios of elements and indices on the graine size of granulometric fractions of the deluvium highlight relationships between geochemical characteristics of the lake sediments and deluvial deposits and make it possible to reconstruct the principal evolutionary stages of the lakes. The paper presents comprehensive characteristics of the sediments accumulated during the transition from the Late Neopleistocene to Holocene."

The paper presents the results of laser experiments simulating micrometeorite “impact” on basalt, olivine, pyroxene and some other types of targets. Numerous iron nanospherules that are often arranged into chains and clusters were found in the molten products of the “impact.” The experiments showed that npFe 0 can be formed without the participation of implanted solar wind ions (hydrogen ions) as a reducing agent, as well as without iron condensation from shock-formed vapor. Similar clusters of nanophase metallic iron and chain structures are observed in the impact glasses of the lunar regolith and asteroid particles."

It was found that the equilibrium γ(Ni x Fe 1 – x )–Fe oxides constrains oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) at the NNO–IW range. For γ(Ni x Fe 1 – x ) with an iron mole fraction x ≥ 0.5, f O 2 approaches the IW buffer. The reaction of kamacite, α(Ni 0.05 Fe 0.95 ), with oxygen is close to the IW–IM buffer reactions. The f O 2 values of awaruite preservation are no higher than ∆QFM = –(7.8–5.2) at T = 400–600 K and increase to ∆QFM = –(2.7–2.0) at T > 1000–1200 K. The obtained approximations of the temperature dependence of f O 2 can be used to estimate the redox conditions in low-sulfide systems containing Ni x Fe 1 – x under the conditions of the Earth’s crust."

    "title": "Actinides in the Soil Chronosequence of the Amur River Floodplain",
    "abstract": "Abstract For the first time, a study was conducted at the Russian Far East to assess the rate of accumulation of gross and mobile forms of actinides (U and Th) in a 5000-year-old soil chronosequence embedded within the floodplain of the middle reaches of the Amur River. The relationships between actinides and the properties of alluvial and residual alluvial soils are characterized using regression models. It was found that during the evolution, the content of the gross form of actinides in the soils of the automorphic series increased from 1 to 2 mg/kg for U and from 4 to 10 mg/kg for Th. In the soils of the hydromorphic series, the increase over a shorter time period (2600 years) was from 1 to 3 mg/kg for U and from 4 to 12 mg/kg for Th. The content of the mobile U form in automorphic and hydromorphic soils increased on average from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg, and that of Th, from 0.02 to 0.2 mg/kg. In the automorphic soils, the accumulation of U is observed as long as the floodplain is regularly flooded, while Th continues to accumulate even after the floodplain leaves the flood zone. In the hydromorphic soils, the accumulation of actinides continues over the entire chronological range. The results obtained show that the main soil properties determining the accumulation of actinides in soils are the content of clay minerals and iron oxides. The intake of actinides into the soils of the Amur River floodplain occurs mainly due to the weathering of melanocratic granitoid minerals in the alluvium. The mobilization of actinides is affected by pH in automorphic soils and Eh in hydromorphic soils."

    "title": "Age, Genesis and Geological Significance of Granodiorite in the Lajiepu Mining Area, Western Gangdese Metallogenic Belt, South Tibet",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Lajiepu mining area is located in the western section of the southern margin of the Gangdese metallogenic belt. Understanding the formation mechanism of the Paleogene granite here is crucial for discussing the genesis and tectonic background of arc magmatic rocks in the Angren area, also on the southern margin of Gangdese. This study employs zircon U–Pb dating, Hf isotopes, rock geochemistry, and Sr–Nd–Pb isotope analyses of granodiorite samples from the mining area. The results show that LA-ICP-MS zircon U–Pb dating yields a weighted average age of 50.10 ± 0.51 Ma, placing the emplacement of these intrusive rocks in the Early Eocene. Geochemical data classify the pluton as high-potassium calc-alkaline, with A/CNK values between 0.94 and 1.02, indicating it is an I-type granite. The rock is enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) such as Rb and Ba and depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE) like P, Nb, and Ti. Light rare earth elements (LREE) are enriched, while heavy rare earth elements (HREE) show no significant differentiation, and moderate negative Eu anomalies (δEu = 0.65–0.76) are present. The ε Hf (t) values of the pluton’s zircon range from 3.03 to 7.09, with two-stage model ages (T DM2 ) between 676 and 932 Ma. The initial ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i values range from 0.705637 to 0.705732, and the ε Nd (t) values range from –0.38 to –0.28, with two-stage Nd model ages (T DM2 ) between 883 and 890 Ma. These findings suggest a magma source region with characteristics of both mantle-derived and crust-mantle mixed sources. Additionally, lead isotope data further support a crust-mantle mixed source within the orogenic belt. Combining the regional geological background, the formation of the rock mass is related to the partial melting of the newly formed lower crust caused by the upwelling of the mantle source material of the Neo-Tethys oceanic crust after the Indo-Asian continental collision. The material source of granodiorite includes crust source and mantle source. At this time, it may still be in the early stages of the Indo-Asian continental collision."

    "abstract": "Abstract Original data were obtained on the composition and content of medium-volatility organic compounds in cold carbonaceous mineral waters from the Shmakovka deposit in Primorsky Krai. Using capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and solid-phase extraction, a number of organic components forming 16 homologous series were identified. The results revealed the predominance of aliphatic hydrocarbons (mainly normal alkanes and isoalkanes) in the carbonaceous waters, accounting for more than half of the total organic compounds. The remaining compounds include oxygen-containing and aromatic compounds, with the latter being present in minor amounts. Based on the molecular weight distribution of saturated hydrocarbons, the organic matter in the studied waters is of bacterial origin. The presence of aromatic hydrocarbons is likely due to the action of supercritical CO 2 . Additionally, one of the Shmakovka field sites is likely subject to anthropogenic pressure, as indicated by the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons and elevated phthalate concentrations."

    "abstract": "Abstract Cobalt bearing metasedimentary rocks from the Nasibpur and surrounding areas of North Delhi Fold Belt, NW India has been studied to elucidate their provenance, palaeoweathering, palaeoclimatological conditions and depositional environment. The investigated area is characterized by metasedimentary formations such as quartzites, mica schists, garnet mica schist, phyllites, gneiss, amphibolites and magmatic phases like granites and pegmatites. Petrographic analysis affirmed that quartzites are mineralogical mature, fine to medium grained. On the basis of modal compositions these quartzites range from Fe-sand and quartz arenite in composition. The calculated chemical index of alteration (CIA) values (31.98 to 75.87 with an average of 48.60 indicates low to moderate weathering under semiarid to humid climatic conditions. Most of the quartzites samples have SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 (>10, avg. 43) which indicates high maturity. Cobalt concentration in these quartzites, mica schist, pegmatites range from 166 to 3657, 62–166, and 167–519 ppm respectively. Quartz dilution during hydraulic sorting has led to low concentrations of rare earth elements in the quartzites. The rocks exhibit enrichment in LREE with (La/Sm) n (1.2–7.41 avg. 4.56) with noticeable negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.34–0.74). Evaluation of mineral and whole rock geochemistry collectively indicate their predominant derivation from a felsic source and deposition in an active to passive continental setting."

    "title": "Geochronology and Geochemistry of the Yajiangqiao Plutonic Rocks in the Central South China Block: Implication for Petrogenesis and Tectonic Setting",
    "abstract": "Abstract Clarify the petrogenesis and dynamics mechanism of Triassic magmatic rock in the South China Block (SCB) is crucial for understanding the geological evolution and mineralization of South China. A series of metal deposits (including lead, zinc, tungsten, tin, uranium, etc.) have been discovered inside and near the Yajiangqiao plutonic rock, which is important ore-forming granite in the eastern Hunan region. However, its petrogenesis and tectonic setting are still controversial. Here, we present new zircon U–Pb ages and trace elements, and whole-rock major- and trace- element compositions, and in-situ Hf isotope data obtained from the Yajiangqiao granites in central SCB. LA-ICP-MS zircon U–Pb dating reveals that the granites were emplaced in the late Triassic (227 ± 2 and 226 ± 2 Ma). The geochemical characteristics of zircon and whole-rock trace elements indicate that the Yajiangqiao granites are S-type granite, which originated from the partial melting of crustal material mainly composed of metapelitic sources, with a small amount of mantle-derived material added and undergoing strong fractional crystallization. In combination with regional geological data, we suggest that the late Triassic granites in the central SCB likely were the response to the underplating of mantle-derived magmas in a post-collision setting."

    "title": "Application of petrophysically and geologically guided inversion to aeromagnetic and drilling data for investigation of magnetite ore in Pocheon, Korea",
    "abstract": "Around Pocheon, Korea, geological and geophysical investigations have been performed for the magnetite ore deposits within the Gonamsan intrusion. In 2022, a new ore body was identified by drilling operations based on the interpretation results of drone-based aeromagnetic survey data, and its three-dimensional shape was constructed based on the interpretation sections of drilling cores. By utilizing these data, the objective of this study is to investigate the deterministic framework which can roughly estimate the potential resources of the ore deposit from aeromagnetic survey data. Conventional geophysical inversion has limitations in delineating the boundaries of anomalous bodies, since it suffers from a non-uniqueness problem, especially for potential field data (Wei and Sun in Geophysics 86:G133–G158, 2021 ). Furthermore, some parts of the aeromagnetic data used in this study were collected at a higher altitude, resulting in an increment of the uncertainties of the inversion results. Astic and Oldenburg (Geophys J Int 219:1989–2012, 2019 ) proposed petrophysically and geologically guided inversion (PGI), which is able to provide statistical criteria of boundaries from the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) including petrophysical and geological prior information. Based on the PGI framework, we define parameters of GMM from susceptibility information of drilling cores around the new ore body and perform PGI of both maintaining the original GMM and updating it during the inversion process. We interpreted PGI results based on the property and probability of original and learned GMM, and the volume of the isolated ore bodies was consistent with the volume of our target magnetite deposit. This case study demonstrates the potential of the PGI as an analytical tool for quantitative potential resources’ estimation of ore bodies in mineral exploration."

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies of molecular and hydrocarbon composition of marine sediments provide important information on sedimentary organic matter (OM). In this work, the distribution of hydrocarbons and molecular markers with depth in the sedimentary cover of the linear depression of the West Kara stage was studied. To do this, two sediment cores were sampled during 89 th cruise of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh at site 7444 and at background site 7441. The distribution of n-alkanes was measured by GC-MS analysis, and the distribution patterns of the biomarker indices of sedimentary OM in the marine sediments with depth were determined. It was shown that higher terrestrial vegetation was the dominant source to the sedimentary OM of marine sediments at sites 7444 and 7441. The OM is of low maturity, as follows from its Ts/(Ts + Tm) ratio. According to the values of H31-S/H31-(S + R) and NAR indices, a small constant inflow of oil hydrocarbons occurs in the study area, and a much lower inflow takes place at background site 7441. The distribution of the CPI25–33, TAR, and NAR suggest that hydrocarbons of anthropogenic origin occur in the near-surface layers of 0–15 cm sediment at background site 7441."

    "title": "Numerical simulation of probabilistic CO2 behavior based on 3D lithology model in heterogeneous geologic formation in the Janggi Basin, Korea",
    "abstract": "This study presents a detailed probabilistic assessment of geologic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) storage in the Janggi Basin, a potential onshore pilot site in Korea. A comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) geologic and lithology model was developed using geostatistical methods based on data from multiple deep boreholes. The lithological heterogeneity in the Janggi Conglomerate was modeled using 100 lithofacies realizations to capture the spatial variability in rock properties. Subsequently, large-scale numerical modeling was conducted to predict the behavior of injected CO 2 , considering both lithological heterogeneity and cap rock continuity. The results indicate that CO 2 migration is primarily driven by buoyancy, with the plume spreading laterally through high-porosity and high-permeability conglomerate and sandstone formations, while vertical migration is affected by the discontinuity of the upper mudstone cap rock. Probabilistic modeling emphasizes the need to consider geological uncertainties when assessing CO 2 storage potential, with consistent results in high-probability zones and notable variability in low-probability zones. This study provides insights into the risks and feasibility of geological CO 2 storage in complex formations, contributing to the advancement of safe and efficient carbon sequestration strategies to mitigate climate change."

    "abstract": "The West African Sub-region (WAS) is known for its geological diversity, encompassing cratons, basins, and rift zones, which are shaped by complex tectonic processes. This study aims to determine the crustal architecture and thermal structure of the WAS through integrated analysis of gravity and magnetic data, estimate the Curie Point Depth (CPD) distribution and associated heat flow patterns, and investigate the relationships between CPDs, seismicity, and crustal thickness across the region. Our analysis of Bouguer anomaly data revealed distinct correlations with geological features, highlighting density variations across the region. Depth to top of magnetic sources analysis provided insights into shallow crustal structures, with depths > 1.5 km. CPD estimations, varying between 7.41 ± 1.13 and 50.88 ± 9.78 km, offered crucial information on the region's thermal structure. Heat flow computations derived from CPD estimates ranged from 27.07 to 185.86 mW/m 2 , identifying potential geothermal resources. The study revealed that regions with shallow CPDs (< 30 km) correspond to lower-magnitude seismicity, while deeper CPDs (> 30 km) correlate with higher magnitude events. Moho depth modeling indicated crustal thicknesses of 25–50 km in the continental regions, with shallower depths at coastal boundaries. This multi-faceted approach has significantly enhanced our understanding of the WAS's subsurface architecture and thermal regime, providing valuable insights for future geological and geothermal exploration in the region."

    "title": "Estimation of radiogenic heat production rate of deep subsurface rock mass using natural gamma-ray logs",
    "abstract": "We estimated the radiogenic heat production rate of a deep subsurface rock mass using wireline logs from a borehole approximately 2 km deep. We first reviewed methodologies to determine the heat production of bedrock based on wireline geophysical logs from a borehole, as well as laboratory mass spectrometry analysis on rock samples. We then applied them to a test borehole of 1 km depth, where a comprehensive wireline logging campaign was conducted, including both spectral gamma-ray and relatively simple natural gamma-ray logging, valuable for estimating the radiogenic heat productions of rock formation. We calculated the heat production rates using the well logging data by applying a relationship between the generic heat production constants of major radioactive isotopes — uranium, thorium, and potassium — and their concentrations. We also used an empirical correlation to estimate the heat rates using total gamma-ray counts. The heat productions evaluated individually based on both spectral and total gamma in the tested borehole ranged from 1.45 to 6.59 µW/m 3 , corresponding to approximately 100–400 API in total gamma-ray counts. The average of heat rates estimated through the two gamma-ray logs of the rock mass is 2.12 ± 0.84 µW/m 3 . Although the heat rates evaluated from the two types of wireline logs were quite comparable across all depths, there were several intervals where the heat production magnitudes assessed from spectral-gamma data were somewhat higher. Laboratory mass spectrometry of rock samples retrieved from the same borehole was conducted for comparative purposes in estimating the heat production. For the 13 rock samples selected at various depths, heat production rates were determined with an average of 1.92 ± 0.54 µW/m 3 , closely aligning with those estimated from the logging data. We then attempted to extend and apply these approaches, reviewed in the test hole, to another deeper well reaching approximately 2200 m. In this deep borehole, we were limited to conducting only natural gamma-ray logging. For the 1500–2208 m depth interval, we measured total gamma emissions ranging from 11 to 116 API, which corresponds to estimated heat production rates of 0.16 to 1.83 µW/m 3 . Subsequently, we determined the concentration of radioactive elements by mass spectrometry analysis of rock samples retrieved from around 2200 m depth and assessed the heat production magnitude for verification. The average heat production rates in the rock samples, 0.55 ± 0.11 µW/m 3 , were in good agreement with those calculated from natural gamma-ray logs of adjacent depth intervals, approximately 0.52 ± 0.13 µW/m 3 ."

    "title": "Hydrogeochemical appraisal of groundwater quality of Tonk district, Rajasthan, India",
    "abstract": "Groundwater is an essential resource for water supplies for domestic, agricultural, and industrial usage in all localities. Analyzing the geochemical characteristics is significant for the sustainable management of groundwater resources. This study investigated 157 groundwater samples of the Tonk District of Rajasthan, India, from the unconfined and semi-confined aquifer. Hydrochemical and spatial plot results showed that the water quality data of groundwater reflects diversity in major ion concentrations. The hydrochemical facies from Piper, Chaddha, and Durov plots indicate that Na-Cl and mixed types are dominant hydrochemical facies. Gibbs plot indicates that rock-water interaction is the major mechanism responsible for the chemical evolution of groundwater in the Tonk region. Chloro Alkali Index, bivariate plot, and Saturation Index suggest that weathering and dissolution of aluminosilicates, along with cation exchange, are dominant processes in the region. This integrated approach was effective in calibrating the influence of regional geology on groundwater chemistry. The current research concluded that the groundwater chemistry of the region is significantly influenced by the geogenic effect due to the chemical reaction between the rock and the groundwater."

    "abstract": "A multiscale fracturing study was conducted on the Early Jurassic carbonates of the Middle Atlas to unravel the complexities of fracture networks. Satellite imagery analysis identified 112 lineaments predominantly oriented NE–SW, NW–SE, and E–W. At the outcrop scale, a one-dimensional (1D) analysis revealed a dominance of small fractures, with the majority measuring less than 20 cm in length. The fracture size distribution follows a power-law, indicating scale-invariant behavior where smaller fractures are more abundant than larger ones. Furthermore, a positive correlation between bed thickness and fracture spacing was identified, suggesting mechanical and lithological controls on fracture growth. Two-dimensional (2D) analysis revealed a network of widely interconnected fractures, primarily characterized by Y-nodes and X-nodes, which facilitate efficient fluid flow. The fracture intensity varied across different sites, reflecting spatial heterogeneity in fracture occurrence. Four principal fracture sets were identified, related to Atlas tectonic compression. Two later, non-systematic sets intersect the existing sets and are attributed to Neogene and Quaternary tectonic phases. The NW–SE fractures are well-connected, forming a highly complex network dominated by Y-nodes, controlling the groundwater circulation in the Middle Atlas."

    "abstract": "The distribution of fractures has a crucial influence on the connectivity of fractures. The discrete fracture network (DFN) model integrating the spatial variability of fracture distribution is of great significance for describing flow and solute transport behaviors in fractures. This study proposes a framework for simulating discrete fracture networks considering the spatial pattern and variability of fracture distributions. Three main types of fracture distributions were summarized, including fracture distributions with spatial continuous variation characteristics, spatial trend variation characteristics, and spatial division characteristics. The kriging interpolation and spatial trend function or spatial distribution function were used to generate the spatial distribution of the facture quantity, and then the Monte Carlo method was employed to establish the DFN model based on the spatial distribution of the facture quantity. Two DFN cases with different fracture distribution types were designed to evaluate the rationality of the DFN model built with the proposed method. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the fracture quantification distribution of the DFN model is greatly reduced compared with that of the DFN model built with the traditional Monte Carlo method, and the RMSE of the hydraulic head distribution is also greatly reduced. The application of these cases illustrates that the proposed discrete fracture network stochastic simulation integrating the spatial variability of fracture distribution can better approximate the real distribution of fracture quantity."

    "title": "A review of phyllosilicate LPOs: insights from antigorite and chlorite",
    "abstract": "Phyllosilicates are silicate minerals with a sheet structure. Phyllosilicates including antigorite, chlorite, mica, and talc, commonly have a perfect (001) basal cleavage and intrinsically elastically anisotropic crystal structures. Studies of the lattice-preferred orientations (LPOs) of phyllosilicates have reported two characteristic types of [001] axis orientations: type-1 and type-2. Type-1 LPOs are characterized by [001] axes aligned subnormal to the foliation or the shear plane, while type-2 LPOs are characterized by [001] axes that form a girdle subnormal to the lineation or the shear direction. The type-1 LPO of phyllosilicates can be interpreted as the alignment of the basal cleavage subparallel to the shear plane. However, the mechanism responsible for the development of the type-2 LPO of phyllosilicates remains unclear. A thickening/narrowing simple shear (transtension) regime for phyllosilicates is consistent with the results of experiments on the development of a type-2 LPO of chlorite, which occurs following an increase in shear strain. However, the experimental chlorite samples were deformed under a lengthening/thinning methodology. The activation of antigorite slip systems may enable type-2 LPOs to develop under simple shear regimes, including thickening/narrowing (transtension) and lengthening/thinning shear. Microstructure studies of serpentinized peridotite suggest that phase boundary sliding between olivine and antigorite contributes to the development of type-2 LPOs in antigorite. However, there is a lack of experimental proof on the development of different LPOs in antigorite under simple shear conditions. Studies on the development of LPOs in chlorite lack detailed microstructural analyses focusing on slip systems and deformation mechanisms. Future studies to clarify the development mechanisms of LPOs in phyllosilicates should prioritize detailed investigations of simple shear regimes and slip systems. In addition, the effects of variations in modal compositions and shear strain on grain rotation mechanisms should be considered."

    "abstract": "Shear wave velocity (Vs) structures beneath Mt. Baekdu volcano (MBV) and surrounding regions are estimated using receiver function (RF) analysis and transdimensional hierarchical Bayesian inversion of surface wave dispersion data. Stations near MBV exhibit complex RF waveforms characterized by pronounced negative signals between the direct P-wave and the Moho Ps phase, indicating local seismic anisotropy or dipping structures. Harmonic decomposition effectively reduced these negative peaks, highlighting significant anisotropy, though notable negative signals persisted directly beneath MBV, suggesting localized velocity-decreasing interfaces. Inverted shear wave velocity (Vs) models reveal a sharp and shallow crust–mantle transition (31–34 km depth) at stations farther from MBV, contrasting with a more gradual and deeper transition (35–40 km depth) beneath the volcano, reflecting crustal thickening (~ 40 km) and an extended velocity transition zone (~ 47–50 km depth) due to magmatic underplating and compositional differentiation. Localized high-Vs layers (~ 4.0 km/s) at shallow crustal depths (3–10 km) are interpreted as solidified mafic intrusions or horizontal sills, aligning closely with previously identified velocity-reducing zones. Lower crustal depths (> 25 km) beneath MBV feature localized relative Vs reductions (< 3.5 km/s), suggesting possibly thin layers of partial melt forming horizontal magma networks. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for seismic anisotropy and back-azimuthal dependencies in accurately modeling magmatic structures beneath active volcanoes."

    "abstract": "Groundwater salinization is considered as one of the most presiding geochemical processes that degrade the water quality and complicate water resource management. The current study is focused on the Yamuna River basin to assess hydrogeochemical processes in the quaternary shallow alluvial aquifer. A total of 107 groundwater samples were collected from various locations across the study area and analyzed for major cations and anions. The study results indicate that there was a hierarchy among the dominating anions of Cl > HCO 3 > SO 4 > NO 3 > CO 3 > F and the major cations were as Na > Mg > Ca > K, and most of the water samples were poor to unfit for drinking when compared to BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) drinking water standards. The calculated irrigation indices, including Sodium %age (Na percent), MH (Magnesium Hazard), SAR (sodium adsorption ratio), KR (Kelly’s Ratio), PI (Permeability Index), & RSC (sodium carbonate) show low to moderate influence on the soil. However, the Revelle index and corrosivity ratio show high aggression in the water toward corrosion. The mineral saturation indices are shown over-saturation with SI Dolomite > SI Calcite > SI Aragonite , whereas it has shown under saturation with SI Gypsum > SI Flourite > SI Anhydrite > SI Halite > SI Sylvite that shows the dissolution of minerals. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that 30.6% variance to the entire contamination load is explained by domestic and industrial origin, 26.6% is completely anthropogenic, and 9.3% is geogenic origin."

    "title": "Dehydration microstructures of hornblende and biotite induced by frictional heating in high-velocity shearing experiments",
    "abstract": "Previous studies of experimental and natural fault zones have shown that the formation of nanocrystals produced by thermal decomposition or deformation can lead to significant slip weakening and large earthquakes. Natural fault rocks contain various hydrous minerals that are easily decomposed by frictional heating and possibly form nanocrystals. High-velocity rotary-shear friction experiments on metapelites and amphibolites were performed at seismic slip rates of up to 1.3 m/s and normal stresses of up to 16 MPa to investigate the dehydration of hydrous minerals (biotite and hornblende) and formation of nanocrystals. Some of the experiments were stopped at various stages of slip behavior to examine the microstructural evolution of the simulated fault zones. During the final stage of steady-state friction, the fault zones comprise a principal slip zone (PSZ) filled with frictionally generated melt and damage zones (DZs) surrounding the PSZ. In the DZs, the color of hydrous minerals becomes darker toward the PSZ, with dark bands along cleavage planes in biotite of the metapelite, and in hornblende of the amphibolite. Transmitted electron microscopy analyses reveal that the dark bands consist of cavity- and nanocrystal-bearing layers along cleavage planes. The cavities and nanocrystals in the DZs were produced by the thermal decomposition of hydrous minerals due to frictional heating during seismic slip. The formation of nanocrystals and dehydration reactions in the DZs may contribute to the weakening of fault zones by facilitating lubrication and/or melting in the PSZ."

    "abstract": "To classify the sedimentary types of the seafloor, image analyses were performed on the deep-sea camera (DSC) images, including semantic segmentation, clustering, and grouping. Segmentation for the classification of sedimentary types was conducted using the random forest-based classifier provided by the Labkit plugin in Fiji, and then K-means clustering and grouping using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were performed. Sedimentary types were grouped into three clusters, and the average pixel ratio of the ferromanganese crust was approximately 0.75 in the ferromanganese dominant (Mn-dominant) type, approximately 0.35 in the mixed type, and approximately 0.11 in the sediment-dominant (S-dominant) type. The GLCM feature analysis of patches corresponding to ferromanganese crusts and sediments within the image showed that they were distinguished at a dissimilarity value of approximately 2. In addition, representative images selected for the Mn-dominant type and S-dominant type were distinguished at a dissimilarity value of approximately 0.7. These results are expected to suggest that image classification using pixel ratios and GLCM features has the potential to reduce subjective decisions by researchers and provide clearer classification criteria. Moreover, it is expected that these semi-automated processes can reduce researchers’ efforts."

    "abstract": "The detection of glacial events spanning from the post-Gaskiers to the early Cambrian across various paleo-continents indicates that the Ediacaran should be a period of multiple glaciations of considerable spatial extent. Notably, a significant Ediacaran glaciation occurred in the North China Craton, with glacial deposits largely confined to its margins. Our study delves into the progress of facies analysis of the Fengtai Formation, distinguishing between glacial deposits and those resulting from mass flow/debris flow processes. We hereby present the compelling evidence for glacial sedimentary succession from two localities of the Fengtai Formation in the Huainan and Huoqiu areas in the southeastern margin of the North China Craton. Our analysis suggests that the Fengtai Formation evolved within a carbonate platform and slope setting, exhibiting characteristics typical of lacustrine margin-slope deposits. This study offers crucial insights into the carbonate gravity flow processes that develop in carbonate slopes. Furthermore, the presented sedimentary succession of the Fengtai Formation contributes significantly to the understanding of tectonic evolution in the southeastern margin of the North China Craton, providing a deeper perspective into the carbonate platform during the glacial-interglacial cycles. The findings hold significant implications for elucidating the development of glaciation during the Ediacaran, distinguishing between glacial and gravity flow sedimentation, and enriching the study dataset of the Great Unconformity."

    "abstract": "The Abu Rushied area is an interesting occurrence of metamorphic-related rare earth element (REE) fluorocarbonate and uranyl mineralization within shear zones in the psammitic gneiss. The shear zones appear to play a significant role in the mineralization and enrichment of REE and U. The study combined field observations, petrographic analysis, Secondary Electron Imaging (SEI), and quantitative Electron Probe Micro Analyses (EPMA) to investigate the mineralogy and geological controls on the REE and U mineralization. The newly discovered REE-fluorocarbonate minerals bastnäsite-La and synchysite-Y are associated with uranyl phosphate (autunite) and uranyl silicate minerals (uranophane and soddyite). The bastnäsite-La is enriched in La 2 O 3 (21.21 wt% on average) and Ce 2 O 3 (3.58 wt% on average), as well as Y 2 O 3 (13.23–15.91 wt%). However, it lacks significant Nd 2 O 3 (< 1 wt%), and contains a certain amount of F (5.28 wt%, on average). Representative formulae for Abu Rushied bastnäsite-La is: (La 0.240 Ce 0.041 Pr 0.130 Nd 0.001 Sm 0.035 Eu 0.008 Gd 0.016 Dy 0.028 Ho 0.012 Er 0.008 Tm 0.003 Yb 0.013 Lu 0.006 Y 0.239 ) Σ0.78 (CO 3 )(F 1.026 ,Cl 0.008 ) Σ1.03 . The synchysite-Y is less abundant than the bastnäsite-La in the mineralized zones. However, the synchysite-Y is enriched in the heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and yttrium (Y), containing 51.37–55.91 wt% HREE + Y. In contrast, the light rare earth element (LREE) contents are much lower, ranging from 2.65 to 5.26 wt%. Notably, the synchysite-Y lacks detectable amounts of neodymium (Nd), europium (Eu), and terbium (Tb).

A two-stage model, with an initial hydrothermal alteration phase followed by supergene mineral precipitation, provides a plausible explanation for the observed enrichment of REEs and U within the shear-zone hosted mineralization. The structural permeability of the shear zones and potential for clay mineral formation could have been important factors in concentrating and precipitating the REE-fluorocarbonates and uranyl minerals."

    "title": "Effect of salinity and solid concentration on the viscosity before and after yielding of natural clays",
    "abstract": "The effects of salinity and solid concentration on the viscosity before and after the yield point of the natural clays were examined. Because natural clays behave as yield stress fluids, the bi-viscous rheological law is a useful and powerful tool for describing the viscosity before and after yielding in yield stress fluids. The rheological properties (i.e., yield stress and viscosity) are positively correlated with the liquidity index. Salinity and solid concentration significantly affect the viscous behavior of natural clays. In the liquid limit state, the viscosities before and after yielding appear to be insensitive to changes in the salinity and solid concentration; however, these two viscosities decrease significantly as the liquidity index (or water content) increases. At the liquid limit, which is higher than unity, salinity plays a crucial role in determining the viscosity. This may be related to the viscous resistance that creates a stronger internal structure formation in saltwater (i.e., flocculation and aggregation) than in freshwater (i.e., dispersion). This was more clearly observed for the viscosity before yielding. Viscosity before yielding was significantly higher than after yielding showing differences of approximately three orders of magnitude (i.e., η by = 1000 η ay ). The viscosities before and after yielding may influence the mobility of landslides because viscosity directly affects slide initiation, acceleration, and flow mobilization."

    "title": "Shear deformation bands in clastic dikes: a case study from the Miocene Pohang Basin, SE Korea",
    "abstract": "Clastic dikes and deformation bands are common geological structures in the shallow parts of sedimentary basins. Although their co-occurrence is relatively rare, some cases have been reported, but their detailed characteristics and formation mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates a clastic dike in the Pohang Basin, southeastern Korea, where deformation bands are prominently developed, using structural observations and material analysis from outcrop to microscopic scales. At the outcrop scale, 1–2 mm-thick shear bands with normal displacement up to 1.3 cm were observed within the dikes. Some bands terminate within the dike, while others propagate into the surrounding mudrock, forming wedge structures. Microscopically, the bands in the dike show cataclastic textures in quartz and feldspar clasts, whereas those in the mudrock consist of well-aligned platy minerals with ultrafine quartz and feldspar grains, accompanied by fold structures. Stress conditions inferred from these structures indicate formation during crustal extension, with a subvertical maximum principal stress ( σ 1 ) and a subhorizontal, E–W-trending minimum principal stress ( σ 3 ). The nucleation and propagation of shear deformation bands in the dike and their termination in the mudrock are attributed to the lower shear strength of the sand in the dike compared to the mudrock, as well as the shear hardening behavior of the mudrock. Notably, shear deformation bands terminating in the mudrock display asymmetric bifurcation near their tips, similar to synthetic branch faults. These findings provide insights into shear deformation in sedimentary strata composed of alternating sediments with different physical properties."

    "title": "Exploring land subsidence changes and its driving factors in mine areas: a case study in the Dagushan open-pit mine",
    "abstract": "Land subsidence in mining areas is a complex phenomenon shaped by environmental conditions and human activities. Traditional subsidence detection methods often focus on individual locations, which limits the understanding of surface dynamics and the underlying mechanisms of subsidence. To address this limitation, we propose Enhanced Short Baseline Subset InSAR (ESBAS-InSAR), which improves vertical subsidence inversion by optimizing the spatial density and quality of observation points, considering both spatial and temporal factors in mining areas. We applied Moran’s I index and Parzen window estimation to quantify the spatiotemporal distribution and evolution of subsidence. To explore the driving mechanisms of land subsidence, we used the Geodetector to account for the spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors. A case study at the Dagushan open-pit mine demonstrated that ESBAS-InSAR enhanced the density of measurement points (MPs) in low-coherence areas, allowing for the acquisition of reliable subsidence data. The results indicated that the subsidence area expanded from the northwest to the southeast, with a spatial evolution from isolated spots to contiguous blocks. The spatiotemporal variations demonstrated significant stratified heterogeneity and local aggregation, primarily related to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Additionally, terrain features such as aspect and elevation were correlated with these variations, and the combined interactions of these factors further amplified their impact on land subsidence. This study offers valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of long-term land subsidence in open-pit mining areas, contributing to a better understanding of geological hazards and effective hazard prevention strategies."

    "title": "Performance evaluation of natural crushed rock filters in deep wells for groundwater control during tunnel construction",
    "abstract": "Groundwater inflow poses significant challenges during tunnel construction, especially in areas with weak strata and elevated hydraulic pressures. This study evaluates the performance of three natural crushed rock filters with varying sizes as filtration media in deep wells for groundwater control. Laboratory tests were conducted using cylindrical transparent cells, filled with rock filter layers and in situ soil, under constant water pressure to measure outflow rates and assess filtration efficiency. The outcomes guided the construction phase decision-making. The findings showed that the mean size of the rock filters had a significant effect on outflow rates. Test 1, with the largest filter size (8.59 mm), showed a maximum outflow rate of 65.3 ml/min but experienced significant mobilization of fines, leading to cavitation near the filter-soil interface. Test 2, with a filter size of 3.28 mm, performed well, achieving the highest maximum outflow rate of 67.1 ml/min. Test 3, with the smallest filter size (1.48 mm), restricted outflow and yielded a maximum outflow rate of 44.7 ml/min. Outflow rate reductions were linked to the interaction between filter size and the movement of fine particles from the in situ soil. In addition, X-ray CT scans showed that the porosity of the filter section in Test 3 decreased from 48.06 to 45.84% after saturation, indicating rock particle mobilization and re-settling. Test 2 proved to be the most effective filter option, though additional measures, such as air injection, may be required to mitigate long-term reductions in outflow. These results provide critical insights into groundwater management during tunneling."

    "title": "Maximum depositional age of the sedimentary succession in the southwestern margin of the Ulleung Basin from zircon age dating of conventional drilling cores",
    "abstract": "Biostratigraphic research has been conducted over the last four decades in the southwestern Ulleung Basin and has provided a chronostratigraphic framework to understand basin evolution. However, absolute geologic ages for the basin are almost absent owing to the lack of deep-drilled cores. To obtain the absolute age from the zircon, we extensively sampled and measured five deep-drilled conventional cores previously obtained for hydrocarbon exploration from the southwestern shelf of the Ulleung Basin. Maximum Depositional Ages (MDAs) for each cored interval are determined by the youngest age groups of zircons and are calculated to 12.1 ± 0.1 Ma for Gorae I-1, 12.9 ± 0.2 for Gorae I-2, 10.2 ± 0.8 for Gorae V-3, 11.4 ± 0.7 for Gorae V-4, and 16.9 ± 0.3 for Dolgorae V-1. All age groups exhibited relatively narrow errors (avg. ± 0.4 Ma), indicating good accuracy of MDA. The MDAs for the cores were first obtained by Laser Ablation-Multi Collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS), and the youngest zircon grains were subsequently reanalyzed by Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP) to prevent age underestimation due to possible Pb loss. The differences in absolute ages of Gorae I-1 and I-2 between LA-MC-ICPMS and SHRIMP methods are below than 0.8 Ma, indicating good verification of MDAs. The four seismic horizons that overlapped with the cored interval were newly established as GR I-2 MDA, GR I-1 MDA, GR V-4 MDA, and GR V-3 MDA (except for Dolgorae V-1 because of the poor quality of the seismic profiles). The newly defined MDA horizons were compared to the biostratigraphic sequence boundaries of (Yi et al., Marine and Petroleum Geology 122, 2020), indicating ages 1 to 3 Ma younger than the biostratigraphic estimates. The four MDA horizons provide a new time framework for sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the Miocene deposits as well as reconstruction of the basin-evolution model in the southwestern shelf of the Ulleung Basin."

    "title": "Reactive transport modeling to evaluate the impact of injection rate on sealing capacity of enzyme-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (EICP)",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of injection rates of urease enzyme and reactant (urea and CaCl 2 ) solutions on enzyme-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (EICP) when enhancing the sealing capacity of a geologic medium. First, to this end, the optimal urease concentration was determined by fitting experimental data of urea decomposition by urease enzyme with time to the rate equation of urea hydrolysis. Using this, the batch modeling was conducted to examine the effects of concentrations of enzyme and reactant on EICP. Then, the reactive transport modeling was performed to identify the impact of injection rate on the calcite precipitation at a core scale with 4 injection cycles. The batch modeling results showed that the concentration of enzyme affected the rate of calcite precipitation, while that of reactant affected the amount of calcite precipitation. The reactive transport modeling showed that the amount of calcite precipitation increased with the number of injection cycles. In addition, the area where calcite was mainly precipitated in the model domain varied depending on the injection rate, with relatively faster injection rate resulting in more homogeneous calcite precipitation across the domain. Furthermore, the calculated permeability decreased by up to 90% compared to the initial value after 4 injection cycles. Thus, our modeling results demonstrated that EICP could significantly enhance the sealing capacity of a geologic medium. This study also suggests that a reactive transport model can be useful to establish an appropriate injection strategy, such as injection rate and cycle, for field application of EICP."

    "title": "Mineralogical and geochemical characterization of alluvial gold deposits in the Betare-Oya area (eastern Cameroon)",
    "abstract": "X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and microscopic methods and profile study have been used to determine mineralogical, geochemical, and lithological features of alluvial gold deposits in the Betare-Oya area in the eastern region of Cameroon. The following results were obtained: the lithological profile of the deposits consists mainly of top to bottom, layers of humus, clay, sand, gravel, and bedrock. The depth of the profiles varies between 250–700 cm and these layers rest on a granitic, quartzitic, gneissic, or schistose bedrock. Microscopic study of the polish section reveals the presence of some characteristic minerals such as sphene, hornblende, and augite which belong to plutonic and metamorphic processions, respectively. The mineralogical composition consists mainly of quartz, feldspars, illite, kaolinite, chlorite/smectite, and smectite/chlorite derived from moderate to intensive weathered and erosion under a warm and humid climate. The sediments that constitute the study area’s alluvial gold deposits are mostly classified in the wacke, arkose, and litharenite classes. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the index of compositional variability (ICV) indicate that the sediments are geochemically mature and derived from moderate to intense weathered sources. The values of the Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 ratio show that the alluvial deposit of the Betare-Oya area are mainly derived from intermediate source (72.7% of the sample); felsic igneous (13.6%) and mafic material (4.5%). The discriminant plot shows a quartzose sedimentary provenance of the sediments. The sediments are dominated by Fe, Ti, and K elements, and clay minerals that recall ferritic soils and indicate intensive laterization. The tectonic setting diagrams suggest collision events and indicate a passive margin source of the sediments. The predicting gold map confirmed that the alluvial deposits of the Betare-Oya area have a significant gold potential, but the N–W zone of the study area is richer than the S–E zone. The origin of gold in the study area can be found mainly in igneous and metamorphic rocks."

    "title": "Source rock potential of coals of Lower Himalayan Gondwana coals in North East (NE) India",
    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the unconventional hydrocarbon potential for source rock in the Bhalukpong and Garu–Gensi road section in Arunachal Pradesh, as well as the Kalijhora and Lish River bank in Darjeeling, focusing on Lower Himalayan Gondwana coals in North–East (NE) India. The objective of this study is to characterize the source rock potential employing proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, and Rock–Eval pyrolysis. The findings of Arunachal Pradesh Gondwana coal reveal hydrogen/carbon (H/C) and oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratios range from 0.527 to 0.959 and 0.103 to 0.274, respectively. The findings of Darjeeling Gondwana coal in this study reveal H/C and O/C ratios range from 0.602 to 0.925 and 0.19 to 0.318, respectively. The Rock–Eval pyrolysis result of Arunachal Pradesh Gondwana coal shows the yields of S1, S2, and S3 in the range from 0.23 to 6.51 mg HC/g, 1.15–292.57 mg HC/g, and 0.1–2.78 mg HC/g, respectively. The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) ranges from 8.81 to 87.05%. Hydrogen Index (HI) and Oxygen Index (OI) data ranged from 13 to 354 mg HC/g TOC and 1–12 mg CO 2 /g TOC, respectively. In contrast, the T max value ranged from 430 to 579 °C. The Rock–Eval pyrolysis result for Darjeeling Gondwana coal shows the yields of S1, S2, and S3 in the range from 0.04 to 4.02 mg HC/g, 0.18–122.85 mg HC/g, and 0.19–6.54 mg HC/g, respectively. The TOC ranges from 15.79 to 72.18%. HI and OI data in Darjeeling Gondwana coal ranged from 1 to170 mg HC/g TOC and 1 to 41 mg CO 2 /g TOC, respectively. HI and OI value for Arunachal Pradesh Gondwana coal is found to be from 13 to 354 mg HC/g TOC and 1 to 12 mg CO 2 /g TOC. In contrast, the T max value in Darjeeling Gondwana coal ranged from 449 to 566 °C and for Arunachal Pradesh Gondwana coal it was 430–579 °C. The H/C and O/C plots identify the coals as mainly gas-prone, i.e., type-III kerogen, and the rank of the coals is sub-bituminous to high-volatile bituminous and has good-to-excellent hydrocarbon generation potential due to their high S2 and TOC. This study provides new data sets for future work regarding the hydrocarbon generation potential of the Lower Himalayan Gondwana coals with respect to the study area."

    "title": "Estimation of groundwater recharge rates in small watersheds using regression tree model",
    "abstract": "Direct measurement of groundwater recharge rates in the field is nearly impossible, so various hydrological methods have been used. Especially in areas where long-term groundwater level observations are conducted, the groundwater recharge rate can be estimated by applying the hybrid-WTF (Water table fluctuation) method. In South Korea, thousands of groundwater monitoring wells are operated for various purposes, enabling the estimation of groundwater recharge rates using the hybrid-WTF method. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the average groundwater recharge rate of sub-watersheds by utilizing the relationship between the recharge rates at observation points and the characteristics of each site. Groundwater recharge rate prediction was performed using the regression tree method (significance level 0.05). For a total of 3,886 observation wells, groundwater recharge rates (average 14.66%) calculated by the hybrid-WTF method using groundwater levels were set as the output variable. The topographic elevation, slope, stream, geology, soil, land cover, well density, and rainfall of each site were set as input variables. A regression tree model that classifies into a total of 30 groundwater recharge rates has been finally developed. The input variable with the most significant impact on classification was topsoil (predictive variable importance: 0.59), which correlates with the presence of a soil porosity factor in the hybrid-WTF equation. After applying a regression tree model to all 30,936 grids in Chungcheongnamdo province to estimate the groundwater recharge rate, the average recharge rate was found to be about 12.8% of the precipitation. The province is composed of a total of 609 sub-watersheds, with the smallest sub-watershed being about 5 km 2 and consisting of 20 grids. The REC (Representative elementary count) analysis indicated that the average groundwater recharge rate predicted in more than 25 random grids is almost identical to the original average recharge rate. Therefore, considering the number of grids per sub-watershed, the recharge rate for each sub-watershed can be calculated as the average of the grids’ recharge rates. Ultimately, the groundwater recharge rates for 609 sub-watersheds in the Chungcheongnamdo province were predicted to be approximately 27.53% at maximum and about 2.84% at minimum. While it is very challenging to accurately determine the groundwater recharge rate for specific sites due to their diverse characteristics, estimating the groundwater recharge rate over a certain scale is feasible using big data models, and it is hoped that this will lead to more reliable policies."

    "abstract": "The importance of graphite is increasing with the global shift toward carbon neutrality and clean energy transitions. As a critical mineral for battery anodes, graphite demand is projected to grow fourfold by 2030 compared to 2023 levels, with overall demand doubling during the same period. However, graphite is classified as a high-risk mineral due to its heavily concentrated supply chain, which poses significant geopolitical risks. The globalization of manufacturing and trade has further exacerbated supply chain vulnerabilities by centralizing production in low-cost regions, deepening dependence on specific countries. This letter provides a comprehensive overview of the graphite supply chain and its associated challenges while offering strategic insights for stabilization and diversification."

    "title": "A practicable land subsidence prediction model considering the coupling effect of coal mining and loose layer drainage based on Boltzmann function",
    "abstract": "Land subsidence caused by man-made underground coal mining has always been a common engineering geologic problem. At present, there are many researches on the amount and extent of land subsidence caused by coal mining. However, the loose layer drainage disturbed by coal mining can also cause land subsidence, the extent of loose layer drainage is larger than that caused by coal mining, which increases the deformation risk of structures located at the boundary of a mining area. There are few researches on the coupling effect of coal mining and loose layer drainage especially in Shanxi Province, China, where groundwater is invaluable. This paper proposed a practicable land subsidence prediction model considering the coupling effect based on Boltzmann function. The parameters of the proposed model were obtained by the dynamic step fruit fly optimization algorithm according to measured subsidence data of working panel 1309 in Shanxi. The root mean square error (RMSE) is 20.9 mm, and the relative RMSE is 1.2%. Compared with the same evaluation indexes using the model based on the probability integral method, the accuracies are both increased more than 50%. Land subsidence along the national coal railway above the boundary of working panel 1309 was also predicted. The predicted subsidence was compared with fluid–solid coupling simulation results, and the predicted results are satisfactory. This model is expected to have good applicability to the land subsidence of coal mining considering loose layer drainage without too many geomechanical parameters which are difficult and cost to obtain. It can accurately predict land subsidence caused by coal mining under the condition where the loose layer contains water. The prediction result can reconcile the conflict between underground coal mining and the protection of ground structures within the mining-affected area."

We utilize gravity data extensively in urban planning to gain invaluable insights. Our meticulous data collection and processing techniques improve accuracy in mapping subsurface structures. Gravity anomaly analysis has been proven in many recent publications and ongoing researches to identify the subsurface density variation that may be interpreted as basement geometry of a basin, lateral lithologic changes, and geologic structures including active faults. Gravity models depicting horst and graben structures in pre-Tertiary sediments suggest a complex subsurface environment that continues to impact disaster risk today. Understanding subsurface geologic structures’ orientation, depth, and specific properties can help mitigate the associated risks, especially in earthquake-prone regions. Notably, the thickness of Tertiary sediments varies from 1 km in the west to 2.5 km in the southeast of the study area. The Kutai Basin, above which the Penajam Paser Utara Regency is located, was selected as the site for Nusantara’s new capital and acts as a natural buffer zone."

    "abstract": "Numerical experiments using a discrete element method (DEM) are carried out to explore the long-term evolution of shape preferred orientation (SPO) of numerical specimens under large-strain (shear strain > 20) environment. The numerical specimens are the mixtures of matrix and rectangular rigid objects (aspect ratio of 2.33) with area percentages of 10%, 28%, and 49%, respectively. A ring shear rig was chosen to simulate simple shearing flow. The developments of SPO of rigid objects are examined with two statistical parameters of intensity (κ) and maximum preferred orientation ( \\(\\overline{\\theta }\\) ) of SPO. The results indicate that, among the experiments, the long-period cyclicity is observed more prominently at the earlier stage of deformation (shear strain < 10) in the 10% rigid objects experiment on the κ and \\(\\overline{\\theta }\\) graph. This can be explained with a multi-object model in which the rotation of each object follows the theoretical rotation of Jeffery. The cyclic nature of SPO evolution further suggests that it might be difficult to estimate strain from the degree of SPO in naturally deformed rocks."

    "abstract": "Metasedimentary rocks consisting of layered metapelites, quartzites, and calc-silicates in the northwestern Gyeonggi Massif underwent metamorphism and deformation during the Permian–Triassic. As a result, they provide insights into a subduction- and exhumation-related collisional orogeny. However, the metamorphic pressure–temperature–time ( P–T – t ) paths of the metapelites and calc-silicates remain poorly constrained. Based on petrographic observations, P–T – X CO2 (CO 2 /[CO 2 + H 2 O]) modeling, and detrital zircon U–Pb ages, the estimated peak metamorphic P–T conditions of the garnet-biotite schist, kyanite-staurolite-garnet schist, and scapolite-diopside calc-silicate rocks were 7.7–9.2 kbar/560–575 °C, 7.0–9.0 kbar/625–670 °C, and 6.2–7.5 kbar/550–575 °C (at X CO2 = 0.05), respectively, during the Middle Triassic (244–239 Ma). Subsequently, both the metapelites and calc-silicates underwent retrograde metamorphism at ~ 4 kbar and ~ 500 °C. The metapelites and calc-silicates in the northwestern Gyeonggi Massif underwent a clockwise P–T – t path under amphibolite- and greenschist-facies conditions, accompanied by shearing and folding during the Permian–Triassic collisional orogeny. This evolution is almost identical to that experienced by the Neoproterozoic–Devonian metasedimentary rocks in the Hongseong–Imjingang Belt."

    "abstract": "Rockbursts often cause severe damage to excavation working faces, equipment failure, and personnel casualties. To rationally process fuzzy and uncertain information in rockburst prediction, a rockburst intensity evaluation model integrating unascertained measure and evidence theory was developed. First, based on rockburst intensity classification criteria, single-index measurement functions for rockburst intensity evaluation were established using unascertained measure theory. Addressing the uncertainty in indicator weighting, evidence theory was employed to fuse multiple subjective and objective weights obtained through analytic hierarchy process, Delphi method, CRITIC, entropy weight, and anti-entropy weight methods. Subsequently, 16 sets of underground engineering rockburst data were selected as samples for intensity evaluation, with comparative analysis conducted against multi-dimensional cloud model, entropy-normal cloud model, RS-TOPSIS methods, and actual field observations. Finally, the proposed model was applied to assess rockburst intensity in the SPD9 cavern of Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station. The results demonstrate that the proposed unascertained measure-evidence theory model achieves higher accuracy compared with other methods, with evaluation outcomes aligning well with actual observations. This model provides theoretical guidance for practical rockburst intensity assessment in engineering projects."

    "abstract": "Nestled in the north-central expanse of the Qaidam Basin, the Mahai Salt Lake situated within the Saishten Depression boasts a profusion of low-grade solid potash ores of considerable economic significance. This study employs various test methods, including rock thin-section identification, X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscope–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, to analyze the mineral composition and structure, and investigates the depositional characteristics and genesis of polyhalite in low-grade solid potash ores. The results show that polyhalite is mainly distributed within the easily soluble layer, situated between halite crystals and detritus, with higher mineralization. Primary and secondary polyhalite genesis are discerned. Primary genesis by protogenic manifestation arises through the infusion of Ca-rich chloride brine into K–Mg-rich inter-crystalline magnesium sulfate subtype brine, within the convoluted evolution of multi-phase neotectonic movements, hydrological system adjustments, and recurrent arid-cold climate. Secondary genesis occurs by the metasomatism of gypsum and bassanite. The thickness and content of polyhalite in different layers display a linear trend from the northwest toward the east-central direction. This distribution is primarily governed by regional tectonic activities, establishing the east-central area as the focal region for polyhalite enrichment. The shallow distribution of polyhalite necessitates the need for the development of a suitable scheme for water-level control to optimize mining efficiency."

A mixed algorithm is required to incorporate both techniques into a unified algorithm called inertial axes constraint (IAC), which offers flexibility in its implementation to deal with or without prior geological information. The proposed IAC computational scheme is equipped with the compactness (Cm) regularization. The subsurface models obtained from the inversion based on DW and IAC are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative approximations. Furthermore, a fundamental uncertainty quantification of ambiguity of the subsurface model is conducted based on synthetic data modeling. As a result, the proposed IAC method yields satisfactory results in both synthetic and field datasets located in Lengguru Fold-and-Thrust Belt (LFTB), West Papua, Indonesia. A Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) has been utilized to measure the result of the synthetical inverse modeling, and it was found that the PCC value based on the IAC method is 0.6, while the PCC value from the DW method is 0.1. It is concluded that incorporating prior geological information through the IAC method provides a better model solution compared to the DW method. The field datasets implementation reveals multiple dippings bed structures toward the east as the part of LFTB structures in the study area. Additionally, the intrusive body of Kwasitore granite is also delineated at its eastern part of the WSW-ENE gravity line profile. The IAC modeling results correspond well to the known LFTB geological settings and are more geologically reliable compared to the DW modeling result."

    "title": "Experimental study of acid couple microemulsion to release blockage in condensate gas reservoirs",
    "abstract": "Condensate blockage has been restricting the production of condensate gas reservoirs, and the development of technology to relieve blockage and efficient development has been in focus. In this paper, the idea of acid couple microemulsion (AME) was carried out to relieve condensate blockage from Pinghu Formation in the Kongqueting gas field of Xihu Sag, East China Sea. The surface tension, particle size, and micromorphology of AME were evaluated using surface tension instrumentation, transmission electron microscopy, and laser particle size measurement. Then the optimum AME was selected by dissolution experiment, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, wetting inversion and core flow test. The results show that the optimum AME formulation obtained in this paper is 1% microemulsion + 10% hydrochloric acid + 5% formic acid + 1.5% citric acid + 1.5% corrosion inhibitor. The nanoparticle size and ultra-low surface tension of AME enable it to improve the sandstone’s wettability and enhance its capacity to wash condensate oil. The average pore size of sandstone increases the most by AME erosion when shut-in time is 8 h. Moreover, condensate-blocked sandstone permeability is dramatically improved after AME treatment, which can provide ideas for reliving condensate blockage."

    "title": "Stratigraphy and deformation of the Bangrim and Anmiri groups, northwest Taebaeksan Basin: implication on the collisional history between the Gyeonggi and Yeongnam massifs",
    "abstract": "Sedimentary strata in the northwestern margin of the Taebaeksan Basin, mid-eastern Korea, provide a key into regional tectonic evolution. These strata are long and narrowly distributed, divided into the Bangrim and Anmiri groups. This study reveals a major tectonic inversion, where the basement rocks are overthrust above the sedimentary sequences. This inversion is attributed to a Late Paleozoic collision process between the Gyeonggi and Yeongnam massifs and the subsequent thrusting mechanisms. Detailed geological surveys and U–Pb detrital zircon geochronology reveal that the Bangrim Group was deposited during the Early Paleozoic (from Cambrian to Ordovician), while the Anmiri Group records an Early-to-Middle Cambrian deposition. Crucially, this study identifies a previously unrecognized thrust fault, herein designated as the “Geumdang Thrust,” which not only juxtaposes these stratigraphically distinct groups but also induces a reversal of their stratigraphic order. The thrust fault is a newly defined tectonic boundary between the Gyeonggi and Yeongnam massifs in the northwestern margin of the Taebaeksan Basin, connecting with the South Korea Tectonic Line. The subsequent NNE-trending thrust associated deformation further modified the preceded thrust structures, resulting in the development of tectonic foldings in the direction perpendicular to the thrust deformation. This tectonic model reconciles the apparent structural contradiction of relationship between the basement rocks and overlying sedimentary strata, and provides new tectonic insights into the collision history between the Gyeonggi and Yeongnam massifs."

    "abstract": "Cadmium-contaminated soil is a serious environmental problem because of its effects on crop production, the soil microbial community, and risks to human health. Various commercial amendments are widely used in the immobilization of heavy metal-contaminated soil because of their cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and community acceptance. This study was conducted to assess the effects of the cornstarch-containing amendment (CS) and compare their effects on immobilizing the exchangeable Cd content in soil, reducing Cd uptake by plants, and the soil microbial community development with other commercial amendments such as bentonite (B), talc (T), and activated carbon (AC). The results indicated that CS and its composites (T + CS and B + CS) had the greatest effect on reducing Cd mobility in soil (up to 10% in CS), decreasing Cd uptake by lettuce (up to 78% in T + CS), and increasing the microbial community in soil compared with the control. Furthermore, the results from the Biolog Ecoplate and real-time polymerase chain reactions indicated that the mixture amendments (T + CS and B + CS) had the greatest effect on the microbial community, increasing the soil microbial population maximum by 3.81-fold (in B + CS) compared with the control. The results indicated that applying composite amendments provided an efficient option for immobilizing Cd in soil, reducing Cd uptake by plants and increasing the microbial community."

    "abstract": "The amount of livestock wastewater is increasing worldwide, leading to increasing ammonia contamination in both surface water and groundwater. Therefore, it is crucial to treat ammonia effectively to mitigate this growing environmental issue. This study aimed to utilize the bacteria in natural soil for the biological elimination of ammonia from wastewater, focusing on evaluating the removal mechanisms. The first batch experiment assessed ammonia removal via nitrification and adsorption using natural soil and artificial wastewater, while the second batch experiment focused on evaluating ammonia removal efficiency through adsorption alone. In the third and fourth batch experiments, samples were taken and analyzed for bacterial activity and ammonia nitrogen isotope composition. Ammonia nitrogen isotope data were interpreted using the Rayleigh fractionation model. The reduction of ammonia observed in this study was attributed to nitrification, adsorption, and volatilization, contributing approximately 29%, 33%, and 38% to the overall reduction, respectively. The phylum Proteobacteria , known for its role in both nitrification and denitrification processes, dominated throughout the study period. The enrichment factor associated with ammonia nitrification in this study ranged from −13.2‰ to −66.4‰, while that for ammonia adsorption ranged from −33.2‰ to −54.1‰. The enrichment factor for nitrification also accounts for the potential influences of slight volatilization and adsorption. This study demonstrates that natural soil possesses inherent capabilities to effectively reduce ammonia levels in wastewater. By elucidating the differences in reaction mechanisms between bacterial nitrification and physical adsorption, this study has the potential to significantly advance ammonia removal techniques in wastewater treatment."

    "abstract": "Liquid nitrogen freeze–thawing is a highly efficient and environmental protection method used to modify and increase the coal seam permeability for coalbed methane extraction. In this paper, the rupture morphology of coal pores under different water content conditions after different numbers of freeze–thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen was investigated, and the freeze–thaw fracturing mechanism of liquid nitrogen was explored. Quantitative characterization of coal-mediated pores and micropores by nitrogen adsorption and CO 2 adsorption experiments. The BET and BJH theoretical models were utilized to calculate parameters including specific surface area and volume of pores, and the FHH modeling approach was utilized to compute the fractal dimension for data on nitrogen desorption. Parameters obtained from CO 2 adsorption experiments were also computed using the D-A model. This indicates that the freeze–thaw effect of liquid nitrogen significantly enhances the micropore structure of coal, thereby increasing the specific surface area and pore volume of coal and reducing the pore width. For coal samples with low water content, increasing the number of freeze–thaw cycles has no significant effect on the improvement of porosity, highlighting the key role of water content in the freeze–thaw cracking process. When the water content reaches 75%, the freeze–thaw fracturing effect is optimal. The fractal dimensions D 1 and D 2 increase with the increase of freeze–thaw times and water content, reflecting the more dispersed pore structure and the fracture phenomenon of the coal surface. This research is useful for the recognition of the process and mechanism of freeze–thaw cracking of coal under the effect of liquid nitrogen."

    "abstract": "A systematic evaluation of Earthquake Environmental Effects (EEEs) was conducted for the 24 March 2011 Tarlay earthquake (Mw 6.8) in eastern Myanmar using the Environmental Seismic Intensity (ESI-07) scale. The earthquake produced various ground effects, including a surface rupture extending approximately 30 km, widespread liquefaction, landslides, and large ground fissures. These ground effects were mapped and analyzed to determine ESI-07 intensity values based on their dimensions and spatial distribution. The maximum ESI-07 intensity in the mesoseismal area was assessed as IX–X. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ESI-07 scale, the derived intensities were compared with those from the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. The ESI-07 values were higher by two to three degrees than the MMI values, reflecting the sensitivity of the ESI-07 scale to earthquake environmental effects rather than structural damage. This underscores the value of the ESI-07 scale in enhancing seismic intensity assessments, particularly for intraplate earthquakes in regions where building-related damage records are sparse or inconsistent due to heterogeneous building code practices or highly vegetated, rugged terrain like that of Myanmar. The application of the ESI-07 scale to the 2011 Tarlay earthquake (Mw 6.8) illustrates its potential for assessing other recent and historical seismic events across Myanmar and other intraplate regions in South Asia, contributing to improved seismic intensity estimation and hazard analysis."

    "abstract": "The safe management and long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste are crucial for safeguarding humanity and the environment from radioactive hazards and are regarded as a significant challenge for the global nuclear industry. This paper analyzes site selection criteria related to geological investigations in the cases of Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and France, which have either selected or proposed deep geological disposal sites. It reviews the investigation parameters and methods defined according to these criteria and comprehensively analyzes the rationale and importance behind deriving these parameters. Based on the analysis of international cases related to geological site selection criteria and evaluation factors, this paper proposes geological performance verification factors and items tailored to the geological characteristics of Korea. The geological performance factors of the natural barrier are categorized into nine detailed fields: rock and mineralogy, faults and discontinuities, seismicity, Quaternary geology, hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, thermal properties and rock mechanics. These factors are suggested by reflecting the geological characteristics of Korea, grounded in the case studies of leading countries in disposal research and the background and rationale for each verification item are described."

    "title": "The phase of extension and inversion in the Bongor Basin and its impact on the hydrocarbon accumulation",
    "abstract": "The Bongor Basin, a part of Central African Rift System (CARS), presents a complex geological history marked by phases of strike-slip extension in the Early Cretaceous, weak extension in the Late Cretaceous, and significant reformation through intense inversion and uplifting during the Late Cretaceous–Paleocene. These tectonic inversions have played a critical role in shaping the basin’s hydrocarbon potential. This study employs balanced cross section techniques to demonstrate that the inversion processes reactivated both pre-existing and newly formed faults, creating anticlines that are vital for hydrocarbon trapping. The regional tectonic compressional forces have driven the principal extensional phases associated with rift formation and subsequent inversion events. As a result, these tectonic processes have facilitated the creation of structural traps and modified sedimentary pathways, which are essential for hydrocarbon migration and entrapment. Our findings indicate that the initial extensional phase led to the formation of fault-bounded depocenters that subsequently underwent inversion, enhancing trap integrity and establishing favorable conditions for hydrocarbon preservation. The balanced cross section methodology offers valuable insights into the subsurface geometry and deformation history, highlighting prospective areas with high hydrocarbon potential. This research emphasizes the necessity of integrating studies of tectonic evolution with hydrocarbon exploration strategies in rift basins, ultimately contributing to more effective resource exploitation."

    "title": "Evolutionary history of the Pohang Basin reconstructed from offshore seismic and deep-drilled core data: evidence for an early Miocene multi-directional sediment-feeding system and late Miocene trough fills",
    "abstract": "The Pohang Basin is a Miocene basin located in the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula and is one of the most intensively investigated. However, due to the absence of offshore deep-drilled core data, including basement rock, and the difficulties in onshore-offshore stratigraphic correlation, the initial stage of the basin formation and the entire sedimentary succession remain poorly understood. This study integrates newly acquired seismic profiles and deep-drilled core data to refine the depositional history and basin evolution of the offshore Pohang Basin in southeastern Korea. Core analysis revealed 18 sedimentary facies, grouped into five facies associations (FAs): FA1 (fluvial), FA2 (lacustrine), FA3 (delta), FA4 (inner- to mid-shelf), and FA5 (outer shelf to basin plain). The seismic profiles were divided into five major depositional units (Units I–V) based on the lap-out patterns and acoustic characteristics. The basal part of the drilled core comprises coarse-grained deposits of fluvial to deltaic origin, containing angular to subangular, poorly sorted dacitic to andesitic volcanic clasts. Additionally, time structure and isopach maps show that the initial succession (Unit I) was predominantly sourced from the south and east, in contrast to the prevailing interpretation that attributes the sediment supply to the western fan-delta system. These findings suggest that the basin was affected by multi-directional sediment feeding systems during its initial deposition. Based on the palynological assemblages and Sr isotope dating of drilled core samples, the top part of the depositional units was assigned to the middle Miocene. However, the presence of a thick trough fill, characterized by growth strata and compressional anticlines in a seismic record, suggests localized and continuous deposition, potentially extending into the late Miocene. This integrated approach refines previous basin development models by highlighting the multi-directional sediment feeding systems and structural complexity in basin infills."

Main objective here is to provide a clear understanding of sediment concentration relation with dominant basin parameters during recession. Principal component analysis along with multiple linear regression has been performed between NSE and principal component analysis resulting with R 2 as 0.31 and 0.52 during calibration and validation, respectively."

    "abstract": "Isotope data such as δ 13 C and 14 C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) have been widely used for dating groundwater with ages in the range up to 40,000 years. Various single-sample-based (SSB) correction models have been developed for 14 C dating including those proposed by Eichinger (Radiocarbon, 25(2):347–356, 1983 ), Evans et al. (Isotope Hydrol II, 679–708, 1978 ), Fontes and Garnier (Water Resour Res 15(2):399–413, 1979 ), Han and Plummer (Chem Geol 351:105–114, 2013 ), Ingerson and Pearson (Estimation of age and rate of motion of groundwater by the 14C method, 263–283, 1964 ), Mook (On the reconstruction of the initial 14 C content of groundwater from the chemical and isotopic composition, 1972 ; The dissolution-exchange model for dating groundwater with 14 C, 213–225, 1976 ; Handbook of Environmental Isotopes Geochemistry, The Terrestrial Enviroment A, pp 49–74, 1980 ), the IAEA model by Salem et al. (Groundwater flow patterns in the western Libyan Arab Jamahiriya evaluated from isotopic data, 165–179, 1980 ), Tamers (Isotope Tech Hydrol Cycle 11:143–152, 1967 ; Geophys Surv 2(2):217–239, 1975 ) and Wigley (Nature 263(5574):219–221, 1976 ). However, the reliability of these models has never been practically tested, because groundwater data with known ages are not available. This study synthesized geochemistry data, including inorganic carbon isotopes, for different groundwater samples by simulating various geochemical processes that could occur in both the unsaturated and saturated zones. The theoretical groundwater ages were estimated using mass-balance approaches that account for these processes. The same data sets were also applied in SSB models, and their corrected ages were compared with the theoretical ages from the mass-balance simulations to evaluate model performances. Results showed that most SSB models provided acceptable ages in scenario A, where only calcite dissolution was considered, with age deviations less than 11 years. However, when groundwater experienced complicated chemical reactions, the differences became much more significant. In scenario B, which added carbon exchange between DIC and soil gas CO 2 in the unsaturated zone into consideration, only two models developed by Mook and Han and Plummer provided reasonable ages with deviations of less than 100 years, while other models underestimated groundwater ages by about 1500–4489 years. In scenario C, which included silicate weathering and organic matter decomposition in the saturated zone, all SSB models overestimated groundwater ages, with typical differences ranging from over 1400 to nearly 2000 years, and some models showing deviations as significant as 3294 or 4996 years. We found that the results were most reliable when the geochemical reactions that affected the carbon isotopic compositions were corrected from geochemical data. In this sense, we suggest using mass balance methods by analyzing various kinds of geochemical data together with isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon to get better dating results."

    "abstract": "Exploration is a crucial aspect of geothermal studies for renewable energy-based power generation. The Jaboi Volcano has been proposed for geothermal energy with a capacity of 80 Mwe. Remote sensing and geophysical data were integrated to support multi-criteria decision-making for geothermal resources exploration, such as groundwater, fractures, and faults related to the hydrothermal systems of the volcano. Several band ratios were used to clarify the hydrothermal minerals linked to the geothermal system, such as iron oxides, clay minerals, and Fe–Mg. In addition, rock and soil samples in the crater area were collected and analysed using the Fieldspec4 Hi-Res instrument. The result shows that the hydrothermal minerals are dominated by mixed clay with kaolinite, smectite, illite, and montmorillonite, confirmed by the USGS spectrum library. In the geophysical section, a vertical electrical sounding (VES) was conducted at 50 volcano stations. A 1D model generated using the least-squares algorithm shows the presence of local faults in the hydrothermal systems, such as Leumomate and Ceunohot faults, which function as the fluid transport pathways to the surface; the clay cap layer is also found at a depth of 200 m and the reservoir at 400 m characterised by the low resistivity. The presence of the faults is also validated by gravity observation with a high resolution of 200 m/px; the transformation and 3D density methods show the consistency of faults compared to the VES method. Integrating the geophysical and remote sensing data have provided the right decision on the presence of a shallow hydrothermal system in the Jaboi Volcano."

We used a well-defined spatial database comprising 128 landslides and 22 factors affecting landslides in the Eunsan village, Buyeo City, Chungcheong Province, Korea. Optuna is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework for automating the determination of the best hyperparameters for machine learning (ML) models. The results demonstrate the excellent performance of three ML models optimized using Optuna. The LightGBM model exhibited the highest accuracy (a receiver operating characteristic value of 0.932) among the three models, followed by the XGBoost model (0.926) and the random forest model (0.917). These ML models highlight the significance of hyperparameter tuning and selection using Optuna. The efficiency, ease of use, and flexibility of Optuna make it a powerful tool for optimizing ML models and accelerating the research and development process in the field of ML and artificial intelligence. This study emphasizes the potential of these approaches as optimized tools for landslide susceptibility mapping."

    "abstract": "Intraplate earthquakes can produce destructive seismic events despite occurring far from active plate boundaries and in seemingly tectonically stable regions. This study investigates the seismicity and fault stability in the southwestern Korean Peninsula, focusing on the 2024 M L 4.8 Buan earthquake sequence and surrounding seismic clusters. We identified distinct spatial patterns and fault orientations influencing local seismicity, revealing that the Buan mainshock occurred along a steep, NNE-SSW trending, right-lateral strike-slip fault, intersecting nearly orthogonally with a less active WNW-ESE oriented fault. Stress inversion analysis indicated a predominantly horizontal maximum principal stress oriented approximately ENE-WSW. Rate-and-state friction simulations demonstrated high rupture potential for the NNE-SSW fault under current stress conditions, whereas the WNW-ESE fault required significantly reduced frictional strength, localized heterogeneities in fault properties, or dynamic triggering to rupture. The NNE-SSW aligned earthquake clusters and the coherence of their focal mechanisms further confirmed that they are likely in favorable conditions for seismic activity within this fault system. At the same time, the uneven distribution and localized clustering of these earthquakes suggest complex fault fragmentation and localized strain concentration. These findings highlight the importance of detailed fault characterization to enhance understanding intraplate earthquake mechanisms and improve seismic hazard assessments."

    "title": "Detrital Zircon Geochronology of Early Jurassic Successions in the Central Yunnan Basin, Southwest China: Implications of Sedimentary Provenance and Tectonic Evolution",
    "abstract": "The Central Yunnan Basin (CYB) that tectonically located on the southwest margin of the Yangtze Block and to the eastern segment of the Paleo-Tethys tectonic domain, is a typical ‘red bed’ sedimentary basin formed since Late Triassic. The CYB is composed of mega-thick fluvial and lacustrine facies successions. However, the tectonic evolution and sedimentary provenance studies on this basin are scarce. In this study, we report new detrital zircon ages of four sandstones from the Lower Jurassic Fengjiahe Formation (FJF), including four major clusters of 2 060−1 810, 870−760, 485−430, and 280−254 Ma, with sporadic Archean, Cambrian, and Triassic ages. We interpret that the Archaean and Proterozoic zircons were mainly derived from the western Yangtze Block, which may recycle from the Jiangnan Orogen, the Cathaysia Block and the Proterozoic igneous rocks. Ordovician and Silurian zircons were probably from the Ailaoshan orogenic belt, and the Lancang Group in western Yunnan, as well as the Yangtze, Cathaysia and Indosinian blocks. Permian zircons probably came from the Ailaoshan orogenic belt and the Emeishan basalt. The youngest zircon age of ∼212.9 Ma indicates that the depositional age of the FJF is younger than the Norian stage. We also proposed a geodynamic model of the CYB and the Ailaoshan orogenic belt during the Mesozoic. The Simao Block to the west of the CYB constituted the Ailaoshan orogenic belt and collaged with the Yangtze Block during the Early Triassic, provided sedimentary provenance to the CYB. The Changning-Menglian zone that composed of the Baoshan and the Simao Blocks, uplifted in the Late Triassic and provided provenance to the CYB. Collapse of the Ailaoshan orogenic belt in Late Triassic probably provided channel for source materials that transported from the Lincang granites to the CYB. We propose a transtensional tectonic setting of the central Yunnan during the Early Jurassic, after a short collision during the Indosinian Movement in the Late Triassic."

    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of seamount density structure is fundamental to modeling lithospheric flexure and understanding oceanic volcano evolution. Traditional gravity modeling approaches typically employ uniform density assumptions, which fail to capture the internal heterogeneity consistently revealed by seismic studies. We introduce sign count analysis—a novel method examining the spatial distribution of misfit polarities between observed and predicted gravity anomalies—to better constrain seamount density structure. While conventional root-mean-square (RMS) minimization produces compromise density values, sign count analysis identifies distinct transitions in residual polarity patterns that reveal edifice density independently from core contributions. We demonstrate this methodology through application to both synthetic models with known density contrasts and to Jasper Seamount in the eastern Pacific Ocean. For Jasper Seamount, sign count analysis yields an edifice density of 2250 kg m −3 , significantly lower than the RMS-derived value (2475 kg m −3 ) and previous estimates (2380 kg m⁻ 3 ). When combined with a core density of 2750 kg m⁻ 3 , our two-component model achieves closed agreement with observed gravity data. The discrepancy between RMS-optimal and sign count-derived densities provides quantitative evidence for significant density heterogeneity within seamounts, with important implications for flexural calculations and volcanic evolution models. This approach offers improved characterization of seamount internal structure applicable to submarine volcanoes worldwide, contributing to our understanding of oceanic lithosphere evolution and intraplate volcanism processes."

With China’s continued breakthroughs in deep and ultra-deep shale gas, the traditional view that reservoir quality deteriorates with increasing depth faces significant challenges. Currently, there remains a limited understanding of the pore development characteristics and controlling factors in shallow, deep, and ultra-deep shales, which affects the effectiveness of shale gas production. Taking the Longmaxi Formation shale in southern Sichuan Basin as a case study, this study conducted a series of experimental analyses, including TOC, XRD, low-temperature N 2 adsorption, CO 2 adsorption, SEM, and large-view FE-SEM splicing technology (Maps-SEM). The results reveal that: (1) the porosity of the Longmaxi Formation shale in southern Sichuan ranges from 3.37% to 7.49%. The pore types are primarily organic matter pores and interparticle pores of clay minerals, with the pore volume mainly contributed by mesopores (50.8% contribution) and micropores (32.97% contribution), while macropores contribute the least to pore volume at 16.22%. (2) The differences in porosity of shallow, deep, and ultra-deep marine shales are not significant, but as burial depth increases, the proportion of macropores in the shale reservoir decreases, while the proportions of mesopores and micropores increase. (3) The porosity of the Longmaxi Formation shale is influenced by reservoir pressure, TOC, and mineral composition. The pressure coefficient of shallow shale is at normal to weak overpressure, with pores primarily influenced by normal compaction, while the pressure coefficient of deep to ultra-deep shale reservoirs is generally greater than 1.8, with overpressure offsetting part of the stress from the overlying rock layers, which is a major reason for the relatively high porosity of deep to ultra-deep shales."

    "title": "Sediment provenance of the Gunsan Basin and its relationship to regional tectonics in the Yellow Sea",
    "abstract": "Structural and stratigraphic history of Gunsan Basin in the Yellow Sea has long intrigued geologists. However, detrital provenance and changes relevant to the basin evolution have not been thoroughly investigated. This study investigated the sediment composition of the Gunsan Basin through petrographic observations and X-ray diffraction analysis of drill cuttings from five exploratory wells. The petrography and mineralogy of the sediments from each drilled well showed compositional heterogeneity in the lowermost seismic unit (SU-1), whereas the upper seismic units (SU-2 and SU-3) showed remarkable similarities. These findings reveal that the source areas underwent a significant change in association with regional tectonic events, marked by a basin-wide unconformity between SU-1 and SU-2. During the initial stage of basin subsidence, from the Cretaceous to the Eocene, sediments were derived locally from adjacent uplifts and volcanic terrenes, resulting in spatially heterogeneous sediment composition. After a major tectonic inversion and subsequent subsidence since the Early Miocene, the sediments appeared to have been derived from a single yet extensive highland, most likely the Sulu Orogenic Belt. These findings provide fundamental information on sediment composition and provenance and offer insights into the relationship between sediment characteristics and basin configuration driven by regional tectonics."

    "title": "Exploring the Failure Mechanism of the Baige Landslide via Field Observations and Physical Model Tests",
    "abstract": "In 2018, a catastrophic high-altitude landslide occurred at Baige, located within the tectonic suture zone of the Upper Jinsha River. The failure mechanism of this event remains poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the deformation characteristics and failure mechanism of the Baige landslide by employing a comprehensive methodology, including field geological surveys, analysis of historical remote sensing imagery, high-density electrical resistivity surveys, and advanced displacement monitoring. Additionally, the physical modeling experiments were conducted to replicate the unique failure modes. The findings propose a novel perspective on the failure mechanism of the Baige landslide, which involves two critical stages: first, the brittle shear zone bypasses and fails at the lower locked segment, and second, the failure of the upper locked segment, combined with the shear zone’s impact on the lower locked segment, triggers overall slope instability. Physical modeling experiments revealed a transition from initial acceleration to a rapid acceleration phase, particularly marked by a significant increase in velocity following the failure of the upper locked segment. The intensity of acoustic emission signals was found to correlate with the failure of the locked segments and the state of particle collisions post-failure. It offers new insights into the failure mechanisms of tectonic mélange belt large-scale landslides in suture zones, contributing to the broader field of landslide research."

    "title": "Characteristics of Channel Sand Body Based on 3D Digital Outcrop Model: A Case Study of Shaximiao Formation Outcrop, in Sichuan Basin, China",
    "abstract": "To address the shortage of characterization scale of field outcrops, we used the characteristics of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique photography with a wide field of view and a high degree of quantification for image acquisition, data processing, and geological interpretation of the outcrops of the Shaximiao Formation in the Sichuan Basin. We established a 3D digital outcrop model (DOM), which combines the advantages of visualization and digitization the 3D DOM to interpret the characteristics of typical channel sand bodies. Within the study area, we have identified three types of channel deposition: composite channel deposition, crevasse channel deposition, and abandoned channel deposition. Among these, the composite channel deposition was mainly sandstone, the bottom contains conglomerate, with large cross-bedding, and the maximum thickness of the single sand body was 1.96 m. The crevasse channel deposition was mainly fine sandstone and siltstone, with massive bedding and small cross-bedding, and the maximum thickness of the single sand body was 0.64 m. The abandoned channel deposition dominated by mudstone with thin sandstone, the sandstone was mainly lenticular in section, and the maximum thickness of the single sand body was 0.28 m. We identified the depositional model of the studied region, which is dominated by braided river deposition, based on the growth size and correspondence of the sand bodies. The research provides a comparative foundation for the detailed characterisation of the underground reservoir sands found in the Jurassic Shaximiao Formation in the Sichuan Basin. It also serves as a reference for the effective study of UAV oblique photography technology in the field."

    "title": "Detrital Zircon U-Pb Age Analysis of Late Pliocene Deposits from the Lower Yangtze River, South China: Implications for Sedimentary Provenance and Evolution of the Yangtze River",
    "abstract": "The Yangtze River, with a length of approximately 6 300 km, holds the distinction of being the largest river in East Asia that empties into the Pacific Ocean. Its formation is intricately linked to regional tectonic activity and climate fluctuations. However, the exact timeline for the formation of the Yangtze River remains elusive. This study investigates the provenance of the Late Cenozoic strata in the Wangjiang Basin, situated in the Lower Yangtze River, through the application of detrital zircon U-Pb dating. Seven sand samples were analyzed, leading to the identification of new U-Pb detrital zircon ages ( n = 577). Our study reveals that the sand materials found in the Pliocene gravel beds of the Anqing Formation originate predominantly from the Yangtze River. The findings of our study, along with the provenance tracing of boreholes in the Yangtze River Basin and the shelf sea in East China, provide compelling evidence for the continuous presence of the Yangtze River throughout the Pliocene period. The development of the Yangtze River during the Pliocene is intricately connected to both the tectonic adjustments occurring at the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau and the intensification of the Asian Monsoon."

    "title": "Late Paleozoic–Early Mesozoic Tectonic Evolution of the Zongwulong Shan-Qinghai Nanshan Tectonic Belt in the Northern Qaidam Continent, Northern Tibet",
    "abstract": "The Zongwulong Shan-Qinghai Nanshan tectonic belt of the northern Tibet Plateau experienced a protracted tectonic history, including the openings and closures of the Proto- and Paleo-Tethyan Oceans. Although the tectonic belt has been extensively studied, details regarding the tectonic processes involved in its development remain controversial. To better constrain the tectonic processes of this tectonic belt, we conducted detailed field geological mapping, zircon U-Pb geochronology, and whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic analyses. Our results show that intrusive rocks in the tectonic belt crystallized in ca. 292–233 Ma, perhaps in an arc/subduction setting. Geochemical and Sr-Nd isotopic data suggest that Early Permian–Late Triassic ultramafic-intermediate intrusions were sourced from the enriched mantle, whereas intermediate-acidic rocks were sourced from mixed crust-mantle. We present the tectonic model that involves: (1) Early Devonian-Early Permian intracontinental extension occurred in the northern margin of the Qaidam continent (ca. 416−292 Ma); (2) Early Permian–Late Triassic northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean resulted in arc magmatism (ca. 292–233 Ma); and (3) subsequent Late Triassic intracontinental extension (ca. 233−215 Ma). Our results suggest that the Late Paleozoic–Early Mesozoic development of the Zongwulong Shan-Qinghai Nanshan was related to the opening, subduction, and slab retreat of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean, which has key implications for the tectonic evolution of the northern Tibetan Plateau."

    "title": "Co-Evolution of Magmatic and Sedimentary Fluxes Coupling with Supercontinents: Insight from Singularity Analysis of Deep-Time Geological Records",
    "abstract": "Continental crust is the long-term achieves of Earth’s evolution across billions of years. The continental rocks could have been modified by various types of geological processes, such as metamorphism, weathering, and reworking. Therefore, physical or chemical properties of rocks through time record the composite effects of geological, biological, hydrological, and climatological processes. Temporal variations in these time series datasets could provide important clues for understanding the co-evolution of different layers on Earth. However, deciphering Earth’s evolution in deep time is challenged by incompleteness, singularity, and intermittence of geological records associated with extreme geological events, hindering a rigorous assessment of the underlying coupling mechanisms. Here, we applied the recently developed local singularity analysis and wavelet analysis method to deep-time U-Pb age spectra and sedimentary abundance record across the past 3.5 Gyrs. Standard cross-correlation analysis suggests that the singularity records of marine sediment accumulations and magmatism intensity at continental margin are correlated negatively ( R 2 = 0.8), with a delay of ∼100 Myr. Specifically, wavelet coherence analysis suggests a ∼500–800 Myr cycle of correlation between two records, implying a coupling between the major downward processes (subduction and recycling sediments) and upward processes (magmatic events) related to the aggregation and segregation of supercontinents. The results clearly reveal the long-term cyclic feedback mechanism between sediment accumulation and magmatism intensity through aggregation of supercontinents."

    "title": "Assessing the Hydrological and Social Effects of Three Gorges Reservoir Using a Modified SWAT Model",
    "abstract": "As a crucial human activity, dam construction can profoundly impact the surface hydrology patterns. The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), as one of the largest hydraulic engineering projects in the world, has gained continuous attention for its eco-hydrological effects. However, further investigation is necessary to understand the runoff and social impacts of the TGR on the Upper Yangtze River. This study first employed a modified SWAT model to simulate runoff, compared scenarios with and without the TGR, and finally evaluated water supply and demand in the Upper Yangtze River. The results showed a significant increasing trend in the surface water area of the Upper Yangtze River from 2000–2020. The modified SWAT model performs well in simulating the runoff, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Percent Bias improved by 0.04–0.30 and 2–31.90, respectively. Scenario simulation results revealed that the TGR reduced seasonal differences in runoff. During the flood season, the runoff volume at the Yichang Station in the scenario with the TGR is lower than in the scenario without the TGR, peaking at 4 500 m 3 /s. Conversely, in the dry season, the runoff volume of the scenario with TGR is higher, with a maximum increase of 1 500 m 3 /s. The region exhibiting the greatest runoff variations is the Yangtze River’s main stem in the Three Gorges Reservoir region. Besides, the TGR notably alleviated the water supply-demand imbalance in Chongqing during the winter and spring seasons, with a maximum increase of 0.16 in the supply-demand index. This study can contribute significantly to understanding the natural and social impacts of the TGR from the perspective of hydrological and scenario simulation."

    "title": "Geochemical Characteristics of Natural Gas in the Upper Permian Reservoir of the Eastern Sichuan Basin, China: Implication of Multiple Sources Mixing",
    "abstract": "For an improved understanding of gas enrichment mechanism in the eastern Sichuan Basin, South China, twelve natural gas samples were obtained from carbonate reservoirs of the Upper Permian strata to analyze the hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gas compositions, stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes ratios of hydrocarbons, and noble gas isotope ratios. The gas samples in the Upper Permian reservoirs principally consist of alkane gas with a dryness ratio ranging from 127.9 to 1 564.4. The carbon isotope ratio of methane (δ 13 C 1 ) was almost constant at −34.1 to −31.3‰, but the carbon isotope ratio of ethane (δ 13 C 2 ) varied from −36.6‰ to −25.8‰. The hydrogen isotope ratio of methane (δ 2 HC 1 ) also displayed a wide range from −137‰ to −127‰. The large variations in the dryness ratio, δ 13 C 2 , and δ 2 HC 1 with almost constant δ 13 C 1 suggest the mixing of sapropelic and humic origins for hydrocarbon gases in these reservoirs. A high concentration of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) originated from the thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR), which was positively correlated with δ 13 C 1 (or δ 13 C 2 ) in individual gas fields. TSR altered δ 13 C 1 (or δ 13 C 2 ) and resulted in the abnormal character of isotopic reversal in the individual samples. The δ 13 C 1 (or δ 13 C 2 ) in most gas samples, independent of H 2 S concentration, further displayed reversed carbon isotopes because of the mixture of thermogenic gases with various thermal maturity levels. The measured argon isotope ratio ( 40 Ar/ 36 Ar) varied from 310 to 1 225, which suggests that the oldest 320 Ma source rock age corresponds to Permian shales. The analysis of the gas origin and the identification of primary source rock have made a significant contribution to further understanding the resource potential and distribution of natural gas in the Upper Permian, and have great implications for gas exploration in the eastern Sichuan Basin."

    "abstract": "Since the 1950’s, 212 earth fissures have been discovered in the Wei River Basin. During a field survey in 2016, an additional 48 earth fissures were discovered in Anren area, northeast of the Wei River Basin. The characteristics and formation mechanisms of these fissures were studied through field investigations, measurements, trench excavation, and drilling. On-site investigations indicated that these earth fissures were distributed along a fault-controlled geomorphic boundary. Fissures trended at 60°–80° NE and were divided into five groups. Trenches revealed multiple secondary fissures, exposing severe soil ruptures in the shallow earth surfaces. Drilling profiles revealed that earth fissures dislocated several strata, and resembled synsedimentary faults. Seismic reflection profiles revealed buried faults beneath the earth fissures. The Anren area fissures formed in the following three stages: regional extension that initially generated multiple buried faults; seismic activity rupturing multiple strata, resulting in multiple buried fractures; and finally, erosion processes that propagated the buried fractures to the surface, forming the current earth fissures."

    "title": "Locking Effect of the Inhomogeneous Tectonic Lenticular Rock Mass in the Internal Geological Structure of the Baige Landslides",
    "abstract": "In 2018, Baige, Tibet, witnessed two consecutive large-scale landslides, causing significant damage and drawing widespread attention. From March 2011 to February 2018, the Baige landslide exhibited a 50-m displacement without complete failure, culminating in a collapse in October 2018. The mechanisms behind its resistance to failure despite substantial deformation and the influence of the complex geo-structure within the tectonic mélange belt remain unclear. To address these questions, this study utilized a multidisciplinary approach, integrating on-site geological field mapping, surface deformation monitoring, multielectrode resistivity method, and deep displacement analysis. The aim was to evaluate the impact of the intricate geo-structure within the tectonic mélange belt on the Baige landslide events. Findings reveal that the landslide’s geo-structure consists of structurally fractured, mesh-like rock masses, including heterogeneous lenticular rock masses and intermittent brittle shear zones distributed around the lens-shaped rock masses. The study underscores that the inhomogeneous and weakly deformed lenticular rock masses function as natural locked segments, governing the stability of the Baige landslide. Specifically, the relatively intact and hard granodiorite porphyry play a crucial role in locking the landslide’s deformation. Deep displacement analysis indicates that the brittle shear zones act as the sliding surfaces. The progressive destruction of the locked segments and the gradual penetration of brittle shear zones, driven by gravitational potential energy, contribute to the landslide occurrence. This research provides critical insights into the formation mechanisms of large-scale landslides within tectonic mélange belts."

    "title": "Origin of Burrow-Associated Dolomites and Its Reservoir Implications: A Case Study from the Lower–Middle Ordovician Carbonates of Tarim Basin (NW China)",
    "abstract": "The Yingshan Formation of the Lower–Middle Ordovician in the Tarim Basin (NW China) was mainly deposited in a shallow platform, which was intensely bioturbated with burrows filled with both dolomites and calcites. This study aims to figure out the controls on the dolomitization of burrow infills and the effects on petroleum reservoir quality based on petrographic examination, fluid inclusion microthermometry, and isotopic (C-O-Sr) geochemical analyses. The differentiation of burrow-associated carbonates (dolomites and calcites) was likely controlled by the interactions of sea-level oscillations of variable orders and depositional environments. The burrow-associated dolomites (BADs) were precipitated in a relatively restricted (i. e., lagoon) depositional environment during the lowstand of long-term sea level. In contrast, the burrow-associated calcites (BACs) were formed in a water circulation-improved lagoonal environment during the transgression of long-term sea level. Isotopic geochemical data indicate that the BADs in the Yingshan Formation were formed from slightly saline (i.e., mesosaline to penesaline) seawater, whereas the BACs were precipitated from nearly normal seawater. In addition to the anoxic condition, the presence of marine-sourced organic matter and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and a sufficient supply of dolomitizing fluids enriched in magnesium ions (Mg 2+ ) and their Mg 2+ concentration may have played a critical role in the formation of BADs. In the more permeable and disturbed burrow sediments as a result of burrowing, penetrating fluids with higher salinities and higher Mg 2+ concentration relative to seawater favored dolomite precipitation. The fluids with seawater-like Mg 2+ concentration, however, would lead to calcite precipitation. The progressive dolomitization of these burrowed sediments could have propagated the dolomitizing fronts and extended into ambient limestones, leading to the development of extensive dolomites. This dolomitization process can improve the petrophysical properties (porosity and permeability) and the potential as hydrocarbon reservoirs during the emplacement of hydrocarbons from underlying source rocks of the Cambrian to Lower Ordovician."

    "abstract": "A set of ultramafic-mafic-felsic rock assemblages was discovered in the Long-shenggeng area of the eastern part of the East Kunlun orogenic belt. Petrography, chronology and whole-rock geochemistry were conducted on this set of intrusive rock assemblages. U-Pb dating of apatite shows that the lherzolite formed at 492 ± 5 Ma, the granite at 473 ± 6 Ma, and the diabase at 260 ± 14 Ma, respectively. The lherzolites belong to a supra-subduction zone type (SSZ-type) ophiolite component above a subduction zone; the granites formed in an ocean-continent subduction setting; and the diabases represent products of partial melting of an asthenospheric mantle at shallow depth. The East Kunlun orogenic belt features the East Kunzhong and Buqingshan-Animaqing ophiolitic mélange belts, with the latter representing remnants of the Proto-Tethys Ocean. The Late Cambrian lherzolites and granites in the Longshenggeng area were magmatic products of the back-arc ocean basin and island arc formed during the northward subduction of the Proto-Tethys Ocean. Subsequently, extensive island arc magmatism occurred from the Late Permian to Middle Triassic, driven by the northward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean beneath the East Kunlun Block. The diabase may have formed during the transition from subduction to post-collisional extension."

    "title": "Late Miocene Elevated Horizontal Karst Caves and Landform Evolution as a Response to Tectonic Uplift along with Regional Integration of Fluvial Drainage in Southwestern China",
    "abstract": "In Southwestern China, the development of karst landforms and planation surfaces is closely related to local tectonics, fluvial incision, and base level changes, and climate changes. However, researches on when these karst landforms and planation surfaces formed and how they evolved along drainage development are scarce. Fortunately, horizontal caves with numerous fluvial deposits in high karst mountains can be served as time markers in landform evolution. Here we select large horizontal caves to perform studies of geomorphology, sedimentology, and geochronology. Fieldwork revealed that more than 25 km long horizontal cave passages are perched 1 500 m higher than the local base level, but filled with several phases of fluvial sediments and breakdown slabs. The first phase of fluvial gravels and related cave drainage was dated back to 6.4 Ma using cosmogenic nuclide burial dating, and the stalagmite covering the cave collapse was dated by the U-Pb method to be older than 1.56 Ma. These results show that the continuous horizontal cave drainage system and the planation surface were developed before the Late Miocene. The lowering process of the base level as a result of the sharp fluvial incision and water level lowering, along with the regional uplift, led to the abandonment of the horizontal cave and the elevated planation surface at the Late Miocene. After that, the phase of cave collapse, thick fluvial sand, and clay sediments in the recharge of cave areas were deposited at around 1.6 Ma and during the Middle Pleistocene, respectively. Subsequently, speleothems were widely deposited on the collapse and clay sediments during the period from 600 to 90 ka, whereas the deposition of cave fluvial sediments terminated suddenly. The tectonic could control the denudation of surface caprocks and the development of karst conduits before the Late Miocene, whereas the river incision acted as the main driver for the base level lowering and the destruction of the horizontal cave drainage at high altitudes. In addition, the rapid incision and retreat of Silurian gorges finally caused the formation of karst mesas in the Middle Pleistocene."

    "abstract": "The giant Jiama deposit is a post-collisional porphyry Cu-polymetallic system located in the Gangdese metallogenic belt of Tibet. It consists of three deposits: The Main deposit, the Zegulangbei deposit, and the South Pit deposit according to exploration and research. The South Pit deposit is a high-grade Cu-Pb-Zn deposit, but its genesis is unclear. To investigate its genesis, a detailed study was conducted on the deposit geology, geochronology and amphibole geochemistry. The results indicate that the weighted average 206 Pb/ 238 U age of the zircons from the granite porphyry in the South Pit is 15.38 ± 0.45 Ma, and the molybdenite from the mineralized skarn yield a Re-Os isochron age of 15.23 ± 0.22 Ma, in line with the age of the Main deposit (15.7−14.3 Ma). The amphiboles in the granite porphyry of the South Pit, magnesiohornblende and actinolite, are high in Mg and Ca and low in K. They crystallized at temperatures of 705–749 °C, pressures of 0.44–0.67 kbar, oxygen fugacity of −14.31− −13.69 (NNO), and depths of 1.7–2.5 km. Mapping of structure and alteration indicates that the South Pit skarn developed due to the metasomatism of marble of hornfels or carbonate in fold hinge dilation and an interlayer detachment zone by magmatic hydrothermal fluids. According to the age of magmatism and geological features, the South Pit deposit and the Main deposit have originated from the same Miocene magmatism, but the South Pit deposit was affected by the gliding nappe tectonic system. The amphibole geochemistry indicates that the ore-related magma of the South Pit has a high oxygen fugacity and is rich in water."

    "abstract": "The Raohe area of Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China belongs to the Nadanhada Terrane, which was in low latitudes of Panthalassa during the Triassic. The composition of the Late Triassic conodont fauna, derived from limestone lenses interpreted to formed on seamounts, provides important new information on the pelagic biota in this ocean. New conodont samples collected from sections at Minzhu, Minnan and Chigangbei sections belong to three Norian conodont zones. In ascending order, they are: Mockina postera Zone, Mockina bidentata Zone and Parvigondolella andrusovi Zone. The Norian conodont fauna in the Raohe area has distinct attributes: there are a lot of cosmopolitan species (e.g., Mockina postera, Mockina bidentata, Parvigondolella andrusovi ) which enable good global correlation; endemic conodont species are also present (e. g., Mockina sakurae, Mockina shamiseni, Norigondolella nadanhadaensis ) indicating that Panthalassa Ocean conodont populations also contained unique taxa; and some conodonts belong to taxa with much shorter ranges in surrounding epeiric seas (e.g., Carnepigondolella pseudoechinata, Neocavitella cavitata and Epigondolella vialovi ). The presence of the latter “relicts” indicates that the sea-mounts were persistently suitable habitats for many millions of years in the Late Triassic."

    "title": "Rapid Assessment of the Co-seismic Landslide Hazard Triggered by the 2022 Ms 6.8 Luding Earthquake",
    "abstract": "Co-seismic landslides are a critical secondary hazard of earthquakes in mountainous regions and are driven by a combination of seismic, geological, and geomorphic properties of both the earthquake source and the affected hill slopes. On Sept. 5, 2022, an M s 6.8 earthquake hit Luding County, Sichuan Province, China, inducing numerous co-seismic landslides. The epicenter was situated in the Xianshuihe fault zone, one of the most active intracontinental faults in the world. Although the Newmark displacement model is a widely-used and straightforward approach for assessing the hazard of co-seismic landslides, it does not account for other factors such as slope aspect, elevation, slope curvature, distance to rivers, and seismic intensity. To address this limitation, we integrated the Newmark displacement model with the analytical hierarchy process, developing a more comprehensive model for assessing the co-seismic landslide hazard in the Luding Earthquake-hit area, where the terrain and clouds prevent the timely collection of co-seismic landslide data. The proposed model considers the physical mechanisms and seismic, geological, and geomorphic factors underlying landslides, making it a more comprehensive tool for conducting rapid co-seismic landslide hazard assessment. The proposed model is expected to facilitate the reduction of co-seismic landslide disasters and the development of preventative measures in steep and complex mountainous regions."

    "abstract": "Microbial participation in biofortification can improve the availability of selenium (Se) in soil and contribute to the enrichment of Se in crops. In this study, a selenite (Se(IV)) reducing strain was isolated from Se-rich soil, and its Se transformation and bio-enhancement ability were studied. The strain was identified as Bacillus pseudomycoides and could reduce more than 93.48% of 1.0 mM Se(IV) in 54 h. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) showed that Se(IV) was reduced to Se(0), and Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) were eventually formed. In pot experiments, B. pseudomycoides SA14 could promote the bioavailable Se in soils and the concentration of Se in Brassica chinensis L.. The concentrations of water-soluble Se, ion exchange Se and carbonate-binding Se in soil were increased by 23.13%, 22.05% and 30.89%, respectively. The Se concentration of Brassica chinensis L. in pot experiments was increased by 145.05%. The relative abundance of Bacillus in soil increased from 0.97% to 2.08% in the pot experiments. As far as we know, this is the first report of Se reduction by B. pseudomycoides . This study might provide a prospective strategy for microbial fortification of Se in crops."

    "title": "Characteristics of Connected Pores and Evaluation of Shale Oil Mobility in the Qianjiang Formation, Qianjiang Sag, Jianghan Basin, China",
    "abstract": "The connectivity of shale pores and the occurrence of movable oil in shales have long been the focus of research. In this study, samples from wells BX7 and BYY2 in the Eq3 4 -10 cyclothem of Qianjiang Formation in the Qianjiang depression, were analyzed. A double mercury injection method was used to distinguish between invalid and effective connected pores. The pore characteristics for occurrence of retained hydrocarbons and movable shale oil were identified by comparing pore changes in low temperature nitrogen adsorption and high pressure mercury injection experiments before and after extraction and the change in the mercury injection amounts in the pores between two separate mercury injections. The results show that less than 50% of the total connected pores in the Eq3 4 -10 cyclothem samples are effective. The development of effective connected pores affects the mobility of shale oil but varies with different lithofacies. The main factor limiting shale oil mobility in Well BX7 is the presence of pores with throat sizes less than 15 nm. In Well BYY2, residual mercury in injection testing of lamellar dolomitic mudstone facies was mainly concentrated in pores with throats of 10–200 nm, and in bulk argillaceous dolomite facies, it was mainly concentrated at 60–300 nm. The throats of hydrocarbon-retaining pores can be 5 nm or even smaller, but pores with movable shale oil in the well were found to have throat sizes greater than 40 nm. Excluding the influence of differences in wettability, the movability of shale oil is mainly affected by differences in lithofacies, the degree of pore deformation caused by diagenesis, the complexity of pore structures, and the connectivity of pore throats. Dissolution and reprecipitation of halite also inhibit the mobility of shale oil."

    "abstract": "Occurrence and abundance of molecular hydrogen in natural geologic reservoirs are enigmatic, due to its various sources, diverse migration pathways and complicated biological and chemical reactions. Natural gas samples containing hydrogen from producing wells in several sedimentary basins in China were collected in this study, and gas abundances and isotopic compositions of these gases were compared with those in global petroliferous basins and deep intrusive rocks. Several geochemical indicators were suggested for identifying sources, migration and accumulation mechanisms of hydrogen in the subsurface environment. Hydrogen contents in natural gas deposits have contributions from various sources with the following high-to-low order: microbial degradation > serpentinization > deep mantle volatile release > radiation-induced water decomposition > thermal cracking of organic matter. A hydrogen-rich reservoir in Kansas, USA, is specifically analyzed to determine its formation mechanism. This study suggests that future exploration of geological hydrogen resources may focus on the igneous rock bodies with overlying dense sedimentary rocks in the continental rift systems."

    "abstract": "Ground response analysis and determination of site-specific ground motion parameters are necessary for evaluating seismic loads to enable sustainable design of aboveground and underground structures, particularly in deep overburden sites. This study investigates the influence of bedrock interface conditions and depth of soil deposits on obtained site-specific ground motion parameters. Employing the one-dimensional seismic response analysis program SOILQUAKE, the ground responses of five representative soil profiles and 1 050 case studies are calculated considering three different site models of seismic input interfaces. The analysis employs the actual bedrock interface with a shear wave velocity of 760 m/s as the reference input bedrock interface. The results illustrate that the selection of the bedrock interface condition significantly affects the seismic response on the ground surface of deep overburden sites. Specifically, the ground surface acceleration response spectra at longer periods are notably smaller compared to those at the actual bedrock site. This may present a challenge for designing long-period high-rise buildings situated in deep overburden sites. It is recommended to select a seismic input bedrock interface closely approximating the actual bedrock depth when conducting seismic response analyses for deep overburden sites."

    "abstract": "Permian—Triassic granitoids are widely distributed along the Jinshajiang suture belt, eastern Tibet, and are regarded as the result of the tectonic-magmatic activity associated with the evolution of Paleo-Tethys Ocean. This paper focuses on the high-K calc-alkaline I-type Rennong (~ 235 Ma) and Jiaduoling (~232 Ma) granitoid plutons, eastern Tibet, which are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), but depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs) with moderate-weak negative Eu anomalies (0.61–0.90). The Rennong granites are characterized by uniform zircon ε Hf ( t ) values (-7.3 to-3.5) and negative ε Nd ( t ) values (-7.6 to-5.7), with old two-stage Nd model ages ( T DM2 = 1.51-1.46 Ga) and was likely formed by partial melting of the basement rocks, whereas the Jiaduoling rock samples have variable zircon ε Hf ( t ) values (-5.7 to +5.5) but negative ε Nd ( t ) values (-7.6 to-7.7) and are proposed to be formed by hybridization of mantle-derived mafic magma, Rennong felsic magma and sediments. Mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) in the Jiaduoling granitic rocks, have similar zircon U-Pb ages (~237 Ma) and zircon ε Hf ( t ) values (-4.4 to +6.3) to the host rocks, indicating that zircons in the MMEs were actually xenocrysts that formed at an early stage in the granitic magma chamber. These results reveal that the break-off of the Jinshajiang oceanic slab beneath Changdu (Qamdo)-Simao Block was in a post-collisional setting, resulted in the upwelling of asthenosphere in the Late Triassic, and then, generated the wide-spread intermediate-felsic magmatism along the Jinshajing belt, including the Rennong and Jiaduoling plutons."

High-resolution continuous monitoring was utilized to obtain breakthrough curves (BTCs), which were then analyzed using the multi-dispersion model (MDM) and the two-region nonequilibrium model (2RNE) with basic parameters calculated by CXTFIT and QTRACER2. Results showed that: (1) YQD flow system had a complex infiltration matrix with overland flow, conduit flow and fracture flow, while the MGQ flow system was dominated by conduit flow with fast flow transport velocity, but also small amount of fracture flow there; (2) They were well fitted based on the MDM ( R 2 = 0.928) and 2RNE ( R 2 = 0.947) models, indicating that they had strong adaptability in the karst trough zone; (3) conceptual models for YQD and MGQ groundwater systems were generalized. In YQD system, the solute was transported via overland flow during intense rainfall, while some infiltrated down into fissures and conduits. In MGQ system, most were directly transported to spring outlet in the fissure-conduit network."

    "abstract": "There was limited knowledge about the flow fluctuations and cycling processes of saline springs in the Nangqen Basin in the Sanjiang tectonic zone. In this work, the flow variations of the saline springs during the wet and dry seasons were monitored using volumetric and cross-sectional methods, and the cycling process of the saline springs was quantitatively identified using the integrated hydrochemical and isotopic methods. The results show that most saline springs in the Nangqen Basin had significantly different flow rates, ion concentrations, and TDS concentrations. The ions mainly come from carbonate and sulfate minerals. There is no internal hydraulic connection between these saline springs, and the impact of seasonal changes on the flow is relatively small, indicating that the saline springs originate mainly from deep circulation. The recharge elevation of the saline springs ranges 3 661–4 990 m a.s.l., with an average of 4 100 m a.s.l. The circulation depth of the saline springs ranges of 240–570 m, with an average of 431 m. The recycle time ranges of 1.15–30.86 years, with an average of 15.66 years. These results could provide a scientific basis for the development and utilization of saline spring resources in the Nangqen Basin."

In this study, we present the contents and grain sizes of magnetic particles within a stalagmite SZ-1, from Shizhu Cave in southwestern China from 70.4 to 22.3 thousand years ago (ka) during the last glacial period. Specifically, the parameters IRM soft , soil-derived magnetic minerals, and ARM/SIRM (anhysteretic remanent magnetization/saturation isothermal remanent magnetization), the ratio of fine magnetic particles to total ferrimagnetic particles preserved in stalagmite SZ-1, indicate the fluctuation of regional precipitation. Obvious half-precessional cycles are evident in these two proxies, indicating that hydroclimatic variations in southwestern China may predominantly arise from the heat and moisture transported from tropical oceans. These variations are likely influenced by shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and fluctuations in the Asian Summer Monsoon."

    "abstract": "Hemipelagic to pelagic (H/P) marls, representing pelitic deposits, accumulated within the foredeep sub-basin of the Dinaric Foreland Basin (northern Neotethyan margin, present-day Croatia) during the Middle to Late Eocene. Syn-sedimentary tectonic movements, paleogeographic position and exchanges of short-lived hyperthermal episodes affected the sedimentation and related mineral and geochemical record of these deposits. Mineral (clay) assemblages bear signature of prevailing physical weathering with significant illite and chlorite content, but climatic seasonality is suggested by smectite-interlayered phases and sporadical increase of kaolinite content. Illite crystallinity varies significantly, and the lowest crystallinity is recorded by the Lutetian samples. Illite chemistry index is always bellow 0.5, being characteristic for Fe-Mg-rich illite. The geochemical records are the most prominent (CIA up to 76, CIW up to 91) for the Istrian Lutetian (42.3–40.5 Ma), but also for Priabonian (35.8–34.3 Ma) samples of Hvar Island. The ICV values (the lowest 1.40 and the highest 10.85) of all studied samples fall above PAAS (ICV = 0.85) and point to their chemical immaturity. The Ga/Rb ratios are lower than 0.2 and K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 ratios are also low (0.16–0.22), implying transition between cold and dry, and warm and humid climate, obviously trending among several warming episodes."

    "abstract": "The response of lake environments in arid Central Asia to climate change during the Late Holocene over the centennial to millennial timescales remains contentious. The reason that primarily paleoenvironmental proxies diverse and the scarcity of accurate quantitative reconstruction records. In this study, we employed diatoms and pollen records from lacustrine sediment in the Aibi Lake of Southwest Junggar Basin to quantitatively reconstruct salinity and watershed precipitation amounts while exploring the associated forcing mechanisms. The results indicate that Aibi Lake salinity varied between 2 and 47 g/L during the Late Holocene Period, indicating a generally brackish environment, and corresponding to prevailing Tryblionella granulata diatom in the lake basin. Westerly-dominated annual precipitation varied between 250 and 320 mm during the Late Holocene Period in the basin, exhibiting a generally semi-arid environment and prevailing desert steppe vegetation. The Aibi Lake has a low salinity of average value of ∼15 g/L and exhibits elevated precipitation (average value of ∼280 mm) during the periods of the 2 900–1 990, 1 570–1140, and 590–120 cal yr BP. The reconstructed precipitation and salinity exhibit a periodicity of ∼200 years, which is consistent with the cycle of phase changes of the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and total solar irradiance (TSI). This correlation suggests that variations in NOA and TSI significantly influence the precipitation and salinity changes in Central Asia over centennial to millennial timescales."

    "abstract": "Geothermal heat flow (GHF) is crucial for characterizing the Earth’s thermal state. Compared to other regions worldwide, GHF measurements of South America are relatively sparse for mapping GHF over the continent based on traditional models. Here we apply the machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the GHF in South America. By comparing the global model, ML finds that South American subduction zones are hotter than the global model due to large-scale magmatism, which leads to the higher shallow arc temperatures than canonical thermomechanical and global models. Combining ML model with the local singularity analysis of heat flows, active volcanoes, and igneous rock samples, it is suggested that geothermal anomalies along the Andean Mountain Range are spatially correlated with magmatic activity in the subduction zone. It is concluded that the ML methods may provide reliable GHF prediction in regions like South America, where GHF measurements are limited and uneven."

    "abstract": "The Altyn Tagh fault zone (ATFZ), which defines the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau, is one of the most striking features related to the India/Eurasia collision. Concurrent with the strike-slip movement, vertical uplift, and topographic building have formed a ∼3 000–4 000 m height difference between the Tarim Basin (TB) in the north and the Tibetan Plateau in the south. However, the spatial uplift characteristics and mechanism have not been well understood, particularly in the Late Quaternary. This research presents a comprehensive geomorphic analysis to establish the Late Quaternary tectonic uplift pattern for the entire ATFZ. We statistically excluded climatic and lithological factors that provided prominence for tectonism; combined with leveling data, river incision rate, and seismicity data, we reveal the along-strike and across-fault vertical deformation variations. The spatial distribution of the integrated geomorphic index ( IGI ) suggests significant differences between the two sides of the ATFZ. The IGI values decrease with slip rates in the northwestern side of the ATF, whereas wave-like in the southeastern side. The significant along-strike deformation difference between the two sides of the ATFZ may cause by differential rheology. These findings are crucial for assessing regional seismic hazards and providing new independent data to understand the Late Quaternary deformation style of the northern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau."

    "abstract": "The Himalayan-Tibetan Orogen holds numerous glaciers crucial for the Asian Water Tower, thus influencing the surface energy balance and climate feedback. Understanding glacier fluctuations is essential for improving our knowledge of current and future glacial evolution, but limited by short modern glacial observations. Proglacial lakes provide valuable opportunities to obtain high-resolution and continuous glacial changes, but detailed investigations remain scarce. For example, there is still controversy over whether lake sediments reflect melting or ablation. Therefore, we selected a modern glacial lake in the Himalayan region, formed due to glacial retreat in the 1960s, and compared its sedimentary records with modern observations. This provides a case study for future reconstruction of glacial changes using lake sediments. Our results indicate that the sediments of the proglacial lake are primarily influenced by glacial meltwater. Stronger meltwater fluxes transport more debris, magnetic minerals, and terrestrially derived organic matter to the lake. In terms of grain size distribution, the fine silt component (2–8 μm) can serve as an indicator of glacial meltwater intensity. Additionally, this study reveals an opposite trend between glacial meltwater variations and air temperature trends over the past few decades. This suggests that evaporation may offset the increase in glacial meltwater, though the multi-century (>100-year) trend requires validation with longer records."

    "title": "Assessment of Future Cotton Production in the Tarim River Basin under Climate Model Projections and Water Management",
    "abstract": "Climate change is significantly impacting cotton production in the Tarim River Basin. The study investigated the climate change characteristics from 2021 to 2100 using climate change datasets simulated per the coupled model inter-comparison project phase six (CMIP6) climatic patterns under the shared socioeconomic pathways SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. The DSSAT-CROPGRO-Cotton model, along with stepwise multiple regression analyses, was used to simulate changes in the potential yield of seed cotton due to climate change. The results show that while future temperatures in the Tarim River Basin will rise significantly, changes in precipitation and radiation during the cotton-growing season are minimal. Seed cotton yields are more sensitive to low temperatures than to precipitation and radiation. The potential yield of seed cotton under the SSP2-4.5 scenario would increase by 14.8%, 23.7%, 29.0%, and 29.4% in the 2030S, 2050S, 2070S, and 2090S, respectively. In contrast, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the potential yield of seed cotton would see increases of 17.5%, 27.1%, 30.1%, and 22.6%, respectively. Except for the 2090s under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, future seed cotton production can withstand a 10% to 20% deficit in irrigation. These findings will help develop climate change adaptation strategies for cotton cultivation."

    "title": "Analysing spatial patterns of population density in Patna for identifying urban clusters and planning priorities",
    "abstract": "Understanding population distribution is essential for urban planning and infrastructure development, especially in rapidly growing cities like Patna, India. Traditional methods often overlook spatial clustering and thresholding of population data, limiting their utility in high-resolution urban studies. This research addresses the gap by introducing a robust geospatial and statistical framework to identify population density clusters using remotely sensed raster data. The study utilized the World Population 2020 dataset and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for data extraction, with Patna defined using administrative boundaries from the GAUL dataset. Analysis revealed that Patna’s population density is highly skewed, with dense urban pockets and a peak value of over 13,700 persons/km 2 . To segment high and low-density areas, Otsu’s thresholding method was applied, providing an optimal threshold value of 6802.24. Following this, k-means clustering was performed on pixels exceeding the threshold, and silhouette analysis was used to determine the best number of clusters. Results indicated that two clusters best represented the population distribution, with their centres located at specific geographic coordinates. The findings highlight areas of concentrated population, offering a practical approach for targeting interventions and resources. This method effectively combines image processing and statistical clustering, enhancing population mapping accuracy. The study provides a scalable model for urban demographic analysis. Future research could incorporate temporal datasets to monitor urban expansion and integrate socio-economic data for a more comprehensive understanding of population dynamics, helping policymakers and urban planners make data-driven decisions."

    "title": "Machine Learning of Element Geochemical Anomalies for Adverse Geology Identification in Tunnels",
    "abstract": "Geological analysis, despite being a long-term method for identifying adverse geology in tunnels, has significant limitations due to its reliance on empirical analysis. The quantitative aspects of geochemical anomalies associated with adverse geology provide a novel strategy for addressing these limitations. However, statistical methods for identifying geochemical anomalies are insufficient for tunnel engineering. In contrast, data mining techniques such as machine learning have demonstrated greater efficacy when applied to geological data. Herein, a method for identifying adverse geology using machine learning of geochemical anomalies is proposed. The method was identified geochemical anomalies in tunnel that were not identified by statistical methods. We by employing robust factor analysis and self-organizing maps to reduce the dimensionality of geochemical data and extract the anomaly elements combination (AEC). Using the AEC sample data, we trained an isolation forest model to identify the multi-element anomalies, successfully. We analyzed the adverse geological features based the multi-element anomalies. This study, therefore, extends the traditional approach of geological analysis in tunnels and demonstrates that machine learning is an effective tool for intelligent geological analysis. Correspondingly, the research offers new insights regarding the adverse geology and the prevention of hazards during the construction of tunnels and underground engineering projects."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on delineating the basement depth and subsurface structures, with a particular emphasis on lithology identification, within the context of the expanding New Aswan City. The integration of Magnetic and Time-Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) datasets were used, serves as the foundation for this investigation. Magnetic data, processed through different techniques, offer insights into the depth of the basement, subsurface structures, and lithology identification. Initial estimates suggest depths ranging from 1000 to 1600 m for deep sources and 130–200 m for shallow sources. TDEM data, collected from an extensive network of stations arranged in both east–west and north–south orientations, reveal the presence of three distinct geoelectric layers. The surface layer is characterized by alluvial deposits with varying resistivity values (53–3651 Ω.m) and thicknesses (10–25 m). The second layer comprises silty sandstone, exhibiting lower resistivity values (2.50–52 Ω.m) and thicknesses (15–145 m). Finally, the third layer predominantly consists of shale and clay, displaying very low resistivity values (<1 to 19 Ω.m) and the thickness of this layer could not be determined in the current geoelectric survey as it extends beyond the depth that was explored. Structurally, the encountered elements predominantly trend in the NE–SW, NW–SE, NNW–SSE, and E–W directions. Through the comprehensive analysis of geophysical data, this study contributes to the understanding of subsurface characteristics and geological features vital for urban planning and development in the region."

    "abstract": "The Xing’an-Inner Mongolia Orogen is a critical tectonic unit for constraining the evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. However, the location and time of the closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean are still debated. Here, we select a representative basin in Dashizhai in northeastern China, using U-Pb zircon geochronology and geochemistry to analyze the sedimentary facies, depositional ages, and provenance. The results show that the ages of the Dashizhai Formation range from 400 to 347 Ma, the Shoushangou Formation range from 400 to 348 Ma, the Zhesi Formation range from 307 to 252 Ma, and the Linxi Formation range from 299 to 241 Ma. The Dashizhai Formation is composed of metamorphic andesite and clastic rocks. The Shoushangou Formation comprises siltstone, rhyolite, and argillaceous siltstone. The Zhesi and Linxi Formations are composed of mudstone and argillaceous siltstone. Geochemical data shows that these rocks are enriched in light rare earth elements and depleted in Eu with various La/Sc, Th/Sc, and La/Co ratios. The Permian Dashizhai Basin is from Permian volcanic and felsic igneous rocks from the Ergun, Xing’an, and Songliao blocks. The absence of the Late Carboniferous strata in the Dashizhai Basin indicates an extension setting during this period. Furthermore, we suggest the Xing’an-Inner Mongolia Orogen was an uplifting process associated with evolution the Paleo-Asian Ocean during the Late Permian."

    "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the largest pool of reactive carbon on the Earth and plays a crucial role in various biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functions. However, it is understudied for a global understanding of DOM molecular properties such as molecular weight, stoichiometry, and oxidation state, and the linkages among them across Earth systems. Here, a meta-analysis of 2 707 sites in 204 literatures was conducted by synthesizing four representative molecular properties of DOM, i.e., mass, double bond equivalent (DBE), modified aromaticity index (AI mod ), and nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC). By exploring H/C and O/C ratios, we examined the relationships among these DOM properties across waters and land systems, and their geographical patterns and environmental drivers. We found that, compared to land system, the mass, DBE, and AI mod were all significantly higher in water systems, with river sediments exhibiting the highest values. The DOM oxidation state indicated by NOSC was greater on average in wastewater (NOSC = 0.226 ± 0.06) and marine water (NOSC = 0.133 ± 0.06) than in other habitats. Compared to waters, the mass in land system showed more strongly positive correlations with oxidation states such as NOSC and O/C, and the NOSC showed stronger relations to bioavailability properties such as DBE, AI mod , and H/C. Among all the properties, H/C and AI mod contributed to the most variations in global DOM properties. In waters, NOSC monotonically increased towards high latitudes, while DBE and AI mod showed significant hump-shaped patterns indicating peaked unsaturation and aromaticity at mid-latitudes of approximately absolute 30° –50°. The variations in DOM properties were significantly correlated with environmental factors such as annual mean temperature and pH. Collectively, we revealed the spatial distribution and environmental drivers of DOM molecular properties across Earth ecosystems, which could shed light on our comprehensive understanding of DOM characteristics and its dynamics."

    "abstract": "The Changxing Formation of the Upper Permian in the Sichuan Basin remains a focal area for natural gas exploration. Previous research on this formation has predominantly focused on platform-margin reefs in northeastern Sichuan Basin, while reservoirs within the platform have received limited attention. This study addresses this gap by systematically analyzing bioclastic shoal reservoirs in the Zhongjiang-Moxi region of central Sichuan Basin, using integrated methods including core observations, petrographic analysis, well log interpretation, and 3D seismic data. Results reveal that the study area primarily hosts porous bioclastic limestone reservoirs, characterized by storage spaces dominated by intragranular and interparticle dissolution pores. These reservoirs exhibit distinct facies-controlled attributes. Key controlling factors include: (1) syn- to penecontemporaneous karstification, (2) sea-level fluctuations governing reservoir thickness and stacking patterns, (3) micro-paleogeomorphic variations influencing early exposure dissolution, and (4) dolomitization enhancing reservoir quality. Based on these findings, two depositional evolution models for intraplatform reservoirs of the Changxing Formation are proposed."

    "abstract": "Abstract With the accelerating pace of global warming, the Arctic glacier region is facing significant pressure from melting. Traditional methods for monitoring glacier surface elevation have limitations. In this study, spaceborne LiDAR was used to micro-monitor the study area. We propose an Elevation-Sampling Point-Slope Aspect Segmented Weighted Analysis (ESSWA) method to analyze the trend of elevation change on the surface of the Kangerlussuaq Glacier in Greenland over the past 20 years. The glacier surface elevation data from 2003 to 2009 provided by ICESat and from 2019 to 2023 provided by ICESat-2 were used, and the data were denoised based on elevation frequency histograms and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm. The results show an overall decreasing trend in Arctic glacier surface elevation from 2003 to 2023. Additionally, glacier elevation changes exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, although the long-term trend indicates continued decline. Using ERA5 data, we analyzed local temperature and precipitation changes, revealing a very close relationship between glacier elevation changes area and climate change. Research highlights In this paper, the original elevation box method is improved, and the \"Elevation-Sampling Point-Slope Aspect Segmented Weighted Analysis (ESSWA) method\" is proposed to calculate the elevation difference. This new approach incorporates two key factors: slope orientation and orbital data point density. Slope orientation affects the reflection and absorption of solar radiation, which in turn influences glacier elevation. Additionally, the method accounts for the impact of orbital data point density on elevation changes. Elevation boxes with higher data point density and greater weight have a larger impact on the average elevation change. By integrating these factors, the ESSWA method enhances the reliability of analytical results."

    "title": "Seismic interpretation for comprehending rock characteristics in underground coal mines – some investigations",
    "abstract": "Proper scaling of roof falls in underground coal mines demands both extensive experience and skilled techniques. Roof falls are responsible for approximately 40% of mining fatalities. There are several causes for the triggering of roof falls, such as laminated strata, slip planes in the roof, moist roof conditions and clay bands, etc. However, the primary contributors are thin-layered strata and the plane of weaknesses present in the development galleries. The roof fall becomes even more hazardous in wide gallery openings and where there is a time lag in supporting the exposed strata. For the past 30 years, the CMRI-ISM RMR classification system has been extensively employed in underground coal mines to evaluate roof conditions and devise suitable support systems for both development and depillaring headings. Even though it is a very well-proven method of support design, it can be challenging at times to assess the risk of roof fall due to the lack of information on roof rocks. Detecting rock mass conditions at shallow depths can be made easier with the seismic refraction technique. The main objective is to acquire a better understanding of the roof condition affected due to solid blasting during the development of galleries, stress release through delamination, and the presence of weak zones in the coal mine roof. In this study, the P-wave velocity was determined along the gallery roof for different layer thickness, uniaxial compressive strength, structural features, density, and groundwater condition, and a relationship was developed. The roof condition was further correlated with respect to roof fall height, and a relationship was framed between P-wave velocity and roof fall height, and also between P-wave velocity and depth of the damage in the mine roof. If the roof fall height and depth of damage are known, the support design can be done accordingly to restrict the occurrence of roof falls. Support design nomogram with roof bolts was also suggested based on P-wave velocity. The outcome of this seismic study also aids in deciding site-specific support design."

    "abstract": "Abstract This study provides insights into the relatively understudied Karoo-equivalent section of Pangarawe within the Tanga Basin, with a specific focus on elucidating its depositional environment and characterizing the types of kerogen present and their implication on hydrocarbon potential. Using a palynofacies analysis approach, organic matter was characterized, and the depositional environments were reconstructed, offering a deeper understanding of the basin’s hydrocarbon potential. The results reveal sediments dominated by sporomorphs, with fewer phytoclasts and sparse to no amorphous organic matter (AOM), indicating deposition in an oxic shelf, mud-dominated environment typical of a shallow lacustrine environment in proximity to fluvial sources. This setting is conducive to organic matter supply and preservation, reinforcing the hydrocarbon potential of Pangarawe Karoo equivalent sections within the broader Tanga Basin system. Kerogen analysis demonstrates a dominance of Type III kerogen, which is mainly gas-prone, with a Thermal Alteration Index (TAI) of 2+ to 3, signifying maturity within the oil window. The findings corroborate the previously published results of kerogen typing evaluated using pyrolysis in the other Karoo equivalent section of the Tanga Basin. This alignment suggests a consistent geochemical and thermal evolution across the basin, reinforcing the regional hydrocarbon potential. Highlights Single Palynofacies association identified, dominated by sporomorphs, minimal phytoclasts and less to no AOM. Palynofacies assemblage reflects deposition in oxic shelf, mud-dominated with increasing fluvial activity. Palynofacies assemblage dominated by kerogen type III, gas-prone, which are matured within the oil window. Findings align with previous studies, suggesting comparable hydrocarbon generation potential, and reaffirming the significant gas prospectivity of the Tanga Basin."

    "abstract": "Abstract We developed a reaction–diffusion model of the Gierer–Meinhardt type to simulate the formation of orbicular patterns in granites. By coupling felsic (light-coloured) and mafic (dark-coloured) materials as the activator and inhibitor, respectively, our model reproduces a wide range of orbicular patterns, including bands and rings. A comprehensive quantitative analysis reveals that the non-equilibrium dynamics between felsic and mafic materials drive their reorganisation into matrix and core structures within the granites. Furthermore, our linear stability analysis demonstrates that the stability of the system, whether stable or oscillatory, is determined by the eigenvalues in the complex plane, providing insight into the two-component reaction–diffusion dynamics governing the felsic-mafic system. Self-organising chemical processes, driven by varying diffusion rates and nonlinear interactions between minerals during the cooling and solidification of magma, can explain the formation of concentric orbicular patterns in granitic rocks. Article highlights Developed a Gierer–Meinhardt model to simulate orbicular pattern formation in granites. Demonstrated that felsic–mafic interactions drive matrix-core structures. Orbicular textures reflect environmental stability. Inhibition strength regulates mineral banding and spatial patterning."

    "abstract": "The current generation of weather forecasting models struggles to generate extreme rainfall events (>204.5 mm/day). Therefore, there is a need for a method to overcome this shortcoming and to provide a meaningful forecast, especially for extreme events. We propose two diagnostics to overcome the limitation of a fixed threshold of rainfall to identify extreme rain events. First, a percentile-based threshold instead of a fixed rainfall value is used, and second, the Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) is used to add confidence in the former. The data from a high-resolution (12.5 km) Global Forecast System (GFS) and its ensemble version (GEFS) are analysed. The 95 th percentile of the model climatology as a threshold of extreme rainfall provides much better extreme rainfall forecasts, and the EFI of rainfall from GEFS further gives confidence in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events, which were missed earlier by using the traditional fixed threshold of rainfall. A gain in lead time of two days is also observed through these forecast diagnostics. A flowchart is also proposed to help monitor the forecast for extreme events."

    "abstract": "This research shows the failure mechanism of the rainfall-induced Durtlang landslide in dipping shale beds, causing catastrophic damage to the BSUP housing complex in Aizawl, Mizoram, on 2nd July 2019. The attitude of the shale bed was ~28° towards N55°E. Intact shale samples were collected from the failed zone, and their physico-mechanical properties were tested under dry and wet conditions. The petrographic study revealed the presence of Quartz, Biotite, clay minerals, etc. The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Brazilian tensile strength (BTS) and point load index (PLI) indicated a 29.00%, 56.79%, and 33.61% decrease, respectively, in wet conditions when compared to dry. A thorough 10-year sum average rainfall and soil moisture analysis reveals a strong detrimental effect of rainfall and soil moisture on Durtlang’s slope failure. The slope was numerically simulated in a distinct element code under dry and wet conditions to understand the failure mechanism. The results showed that there was a 42.98%, 21.25% and 41.25% increase in total displacement, maximum velocity and maximum shear displacement, respectively, and 7.35% decrease of maximum unbalanced force in wet conditions, when compared to dry. A factor-of-safety (FoS) of 1.20 and 0.89 was obtained for the slope when simulated under dry and wet conditions, respectively. The kinematic analysis indicated a probability of a planar mode of failure. The study evaluated the critical parameters of the slope failure in the BSUP housing complex, which posed a significant threat to life and property while emphasizing the need for appropriate characterization of the slope prior to anthropogenic activities in hilly regions for human and infrastructural development."

By integrating information on the Atlas pistachio tree, which plays a key role in combating desertification, particularly in arid areas, decision-makers can better guide their restoration and conservation strategies in the face of environmental challenges. To this end, our study focuses on mapping land use units. In particular, the spatial distribution of Atlas pistachio ( Pistacia atlantica Desf) stands, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), spectral gradient temporal-backtracking (SGTB), and spectral correlation (SC), was used. Sentinel-2A (COPERNICUS/S2) data for June 2023 with a 10-m resolution was utilized. The methodology involved preprocessing, normalization, creating a composite image using spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, GCI, GNDVI) and bands (‘B2’, ‘B3’, ‘B4’, ‘B8’), and a slope map. Training and validation points were coded based on image reflectance and ground truth verification. Classification assessment utilized metrics like confusion matrix, overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, consumer’s accuracy, and kappa coefficient. The RF algorithm showed the highest accuracy (83.31%, kappa: 0.80). The land composition included 0.01% water bodies, 43.53% dunes, 42.70% pastures, 7.66% bare soil, 0.82% urban areas, and 0.77% agriculture, 2.06% other land cover types."

    "abstract": "Seismic noise in the frequency band from approximately 0.003–1.0 Hz is primarily composed of three main components: the primary microseism, secondary microseisms, and the hum. These signals dominate the monthly averages of seismic noise. However, temporary additional signals in the same frequency band can occur, such as those generated by tropical cyclones in the ocean. In the present study, we investigate one such instance: Biparjoy, an extremely severe tropical cyclone that formed over the central-east Arabian Sea. We identified an increase in amplitude in a continuous seismic record from 6 June 2023 to 17 June 2023, during which ground displacements of up to 300 nm were observed. Furthermore, we extracted the path travelled by the cyclone using three-component waveform data, which closely matched the daily results published by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

    "title": "Infrared heating/cooling-induced perturbation in vertical velocity inside convective clouds",
    "abstract": "Abstract Convective clouds evolve through intensification, reorganization, and dissipation mechanisms within their 2–3-hr lifespan, dominating global high rain rate precipitation. Infrared heating and cooling (IRH/C) intricately influence these processes throughout their lifecycle. We have parameterized radiative IRH/C to evaluate their impact on vertical momentum within convective clouds. The temperature change within a convective cloud due to IRH/C has been parameterized by simultaneously solving line-by-line infrared radiative transfer, the heat advection diffusion equation, and the specific moist entropy equation. Then, the perturbations in vertical profiles of specific moist entropy, momentum, and vertical velocity have been calculated. The developed parameterization has been initialized using the ERA5 reanalysis on October 17, 2018, over Gadanki, India, and the HITRAN spectroscopic database. Our results showed a consistent decrease in the absorption coefficient at constant rates relative to pressure levels. Notably, maximum infrared heating occurred near the surface consistently across all times. A positive perturbation in moist entropy and a temperature increase, suggest the effects of IR heating and latent heat release during 10, 11, 14, and 15 UTC, indicating cloud growth. Additionally, the positive specific vertical momentum during the same period suggests updrafts within the cloud, consistent with cloud formation. In contrast, during 12 and 13 UTC, cloud dissipation is indicated by negative moist entropy and temperature changes, accompanied by downdrafts (negative specific momentum). This study emphasized the importance of IRH/C in the cloud’s cyclic dissipation, intensification, and hydrometeor redistribution. Research highlights The parameterization has been devised to assess the influence of infrared heating and cooling (IRH/C) on the evolution of convective clouds. The vertical distribution of infrared radiative properties within the atmosphere has been estimated using HITRAN spectroscopic parameters. IRH/C plays pivotal role in governing the vertical structure of clouds by regulating moist entropy and vertical momentum transfer. Moist entropy disturbances, either positive or negative, induced by IRH/C signify hydrometeor evaporation (growth) or melting (decay) within clouds. The impact of IRH/C extensively alters the vertical velocity, influencing the occurrence of updrafts or downdrafts and subsequently affecting hydrometeor dispersion within the cloud."

    "abstract": "Climate change-induced drought events are escalating, posing significant threats to global sustainability and human well-being. The study focuses on analyzing future drought characteristics in the Upper Dwarakeswar River Basin (UDRB), West Bengal, India, using CMIP6 projections under the SSP370 and SSP585 scenarios. The empirical quantile mapping (EQM) method is employed to correct biases in the CMIP6 precipitation data for the period 2020–2050, using precipitation data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) as the reference. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) is employed to assess agricultural, meteorological, hydrological and groundwater droughts in the study region. We found an increasing drought risk with varying intensity in SSP370 as compared to SSP585 over the study region. Despite variations in severity, both scenarios show a consistent pattern of drought risk over the 30-year period. Also, the central portion of the UDRB is sensitive to drought than other regions. This research enriches our understanding of future drought dynamics at a regional scale, providing actionable insights for sustainable water resources and integrated river basin management policies in semi-arid, drought-prone regions. The findings underscore the importance of localized analyses in understanding the localized impacts of climate change and highlight the necessity of considering rainfall patterns for effective drought monitoring and prognosis to face the implications of a changing climate."

    "abstract": "Effective water resource management in the Lower Thamirabarani sub-basin is essential due to increasing water demand, pollution, and climate change-induced flood risks. The mixing of treated wastewater with reservoir water has led to deterioration in water quality, including eutrophication, highlighting the need for strategic separation and management. This study integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and machine learning techniques to identify optimal sites for dams and wastewater treatment plants, addressing challenges related to water storage, groundwater recharge, and flood mitigation. A multi-criteria approach incorporating hydrological, geological, and water quality assessments was employed to evaluate potential dam sites. Sixteen suitable locations were identified based on topography, flow accumulation, and soil properties, with six sites strategically placed along the river for efficient freshwater storage and groundwater recharge. Additionally, 12 wastewater treatment plants were proposed to collect and treat wastewater before release, reducing contamination risks. Areas such as Melamunnirpallam, Manimoorthispuram, and Muthulangurichi were found suitable for dam construction, while Mehanmmudayarkulam and Pattamadai were identified as optimal for wastewater treatment facilities. This study provides an innovative framework for integrating advanced spatial analysis and machine learning models in water resource planning. The findings support evidence-based decision-making for sustainable water management, helping mitigate flood risks and improve water quality. The proposed approach serves as a model for similar regions facing water security challenges, promoting environmental sustainability and efficient resource utilization in rapidly urbanizing watersheds."

Significantly, the measurements are collected from the NavIC receivers placed at six sites located at different latitudes along a longitude of ~77°E thus covering the latitudinal Indian region from geodetic latitude 8°N up to 32°N (geomagnetic latitude ~0°N up to ~24°N). Major findings from this study show a strong winter and equinoctial anomaly, which are found to switch their character when the stations are either dip-equatorward or poleward from the crest location of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA). Another significant result elucidates the night-time VTEC enhancement as well as large night-to-night background variability, which is mainly observed during the summer months of 2020. Further, this study cross-examines the morphology of the ionosphere over the Indian region using a stable link from the NavIC satellite and presents a lucid comparison of results with the Vertical TEC (VTEC) estimated using the standard International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)-2016 model. Most of the morphological characters of VTEC variations are found in conformity with previous studies, with a few significant latitudinal changes noted above. However, even during the lowest solar activity, large differences are found between the observed and IRI-model VTEC values, which show an unusually strong seasonal and latitudinal dependence and stress for further needful investigation, both in the modelling and the observation domains. Research highlights With the advent of India’s own satellite navigation system, known as NavIC, a new opportunity for ionospheric observations with a very stable satellite link is created. This study, for the first time, gives a detailed account of continuous and highly accurate TEC (total electron content) observations from the high-elevation link using a ground chain of 6 NavIC receiver stations along the longitude of ~77°E. A comprehensive analysis focused on resolving different patterns in TEC variability has revealed that the present understanding of the equinoctial asymmetry, winter anomaly and the summer night-time TEC enhancements compared to the nocturnal background TEC of other seasons falls short to explain newly found features. The contrasting latitudinal changes between the dip-equator and the crest of the anomaly versus those beyond the crest latitudes in the context of anomalous variations are discussed and explained to the extent possible in light of the existing literature on these features."

    "title": "Spatio-temporal evolution of a fluid-driven crack and its propagation: Insights from experiment and mathematical modelling",
    "abstract": "We present a complete numerical solution of a 3D transient, first-principle-based model for penny-shaped fluid-driven cracks, advancing from the existing scaling laws and extending beyond the previously produced (limiting) asymptotic profiles. Our mathematical analysis is complemented by experimental studies that explore fracture growth and the regime of the developed fracture. The study focuses on fracture toughness and viscous-dominated regimes, highlighting the applicability of our hydrodynamics-dominated penny-shaped fracture model predictions. The fracture experiments were carried out in a solid analogue material (gelatin) of dimensions 15 cm × 15 cm × 15 cm in a glass reservoir at a laboratory scale under simulated environments. Since the gelatin is transparent, tracking is feasible, and we track 3D crack formation and propagation in real time. We focus on the operational parameters that affect the evolution and propagation of cracks in an elastic medium dominated solely by hydrodynamic stress or in competition with the solid toughness. In our investigation, the injection rate and viscosity of the fracturing fluids are varied to study their influence on crack formation and propagation. To get an insight into the strain occurring in the gelatin, recorded strain displacement measurements are related to the dynamic evolution of the 3D fracture. The self-similar nature of the physical system of equations suggests that this problem is scale-independent and thus can be related to large-scale engineering applications such as hydraulic fracturing and CO 2 geo-sequestration technologies."

    "abstract": "Bangladesh’s coastal regions face increasing climate-related risks, yet there remains a critical gap in understanding recent changes in precipitation extremes and their implications for disaster management. This study evaluates spatiotemporal changes in precipitation extremes across Bangladesh’s coastal areas from 1991 to 2022. Using RClimdex software and the Mann–Kendall test, this study analyzed rainfall data from 12 meteorological stations, focusing on seasonal and annual trends, as well as extreme precipitation indices. Results reveal complex variations across eastern, central, and western coastal zones, with annual precipitation trends ranging from –14.13 to 8.14 mm/yr. Seasonal analysis showed predominantly negative trends in the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and dry seasons, while post-monsoon seasons exhibited mostly positive trends. Extreme precipitation indices, including consecutive dry days and maximum 1-day and 5-day rainfall, generally increased. Significant correlations between extreme precipitation indices and flood events were observed, particularly in Cox’s Bazar. The study also found the relationship between elevation and precipitation trends, with higher elevations showing decreasing trends. These findings provide crucial insights for developing targeted climate adaptation strategies, suggesting the need for region-specific flood management policies and elevation-based disaster risk reduction measures in Bangladesh’s coastal areas."

    "abstract": "This paper presents physics-based broadband near-fault ground motion synthetics due to various scenarios of Mw 6.0 strike-slip earthquake and its sensitivity to changes in the source parameters, namely slip pattern, nucleation position, and average rupture velocity. The randomization of these source parameters is also carried out on the rupture plane. Further, the parameters and geometry of the fault-roughness and fault-damage zone are common to all the various earthquake scenarios considered. Analysis of synthetics reveals that fault-parallel components are more sensitive to changes in slip pattern and least sensitive to changes in average rupture velocity. In contrast to this, fault-normal components are more sensitive to the change of nucleation position and average rupture velocity and less sensitive to the change of slip pattern. Damage zone trapping occurs in the case of only high-frequency seismic waves, depending on the velocity and width of the damage zone, and affects all the components of ground motion. Effects of damage zone trapping and rupture directivity at a site in the damage zone are proportional to the rupture length between the nucleation position and the recording station. Obtained very large variability of peak ground acceleration in the fault-normal and fault-parallel components calls for the physics-based broadband near-fault ground motion synthetics since ground motion prediction equations may not be efficient for providing ground motion parameters of earthquake engineering interest, particularly within and near the damage zone."

    "title": "Palaeoecological analysis of the early Eocene molluscs from Cambay Basin, western India, elucidates the evolution of the basin",
    "abstract": "Abstract The mollusc fauna from the early Eocene Cambay Shale of the Cambay Basin, western India, has been described recently. A palaeoecological analysis of the stratigraphically changing composition, diversity, and abundance of this fauna was conducted in this study. The statistical tools employed here are the calculation of diversity indices, rarefaction analysis, testing rank-abundance models, and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). The habits and habitat preferences of the members of the fauna have also been considered. A decrease in marginal-marine affiliated, herbivore taxa and an increase in eurytopic, carnivore forms from lower to upper levels, and an upward increase in marine influence as indicated by the DCA and analysis of habitat preferences of the mollusc genera support an onshore–offshore trend in the environmental evolution of the basin. The analyses indicate that the Cambay Shale, characterized by having an overall low specific mollusc diversity, several monospecific mollusc beds, and dominance of marginal-marine molluscs, was deposited in a quiet restricted coastal basin experiencing the early Eocene marine transgression. The basin experienced a relatively open marine environment later. An oyster bed at the top of the mollusc-bearing succession with no marine fossils above it indicates a regressive phase for the upper part of the Cambay Shale. Research highlights Changes in the composition, diversity-abundance pattern, trophic structure, and habitat preference of benthic molluscs in different levels are used to understand the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Cambay Basin, western India, during the early Eocene. Tools such as diversity indices, rarefaction analysis, rank-abundance models, and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) have been used for the reconstruction. The early Eocene hyperthermal and associated marine transgression events played important roles in the evolution of the basin and its faunal composition."

    "title": "Spatio-temporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 over India and its inter-relationship with combustion emissions, ecosystem exchange, and meteorological factors",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the spatio-temporal variability of atmospheric CO 2 across the Indian sub-continent from 2010 to 2020. It examines seasonal fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 in relation to time–frequency variations, focusing on rainfall, other climatic parameters, and surface fluxes. The analysis is concentrated on four distinct regions of India: Northwest, East and Northeast, Central, and South Peninsular India. Using a least-square error-based harmonic analysis, we identified significant periodicities, primarily dominated by the annual cycle, followed by a semi-annual cycle, in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and their influencing factors. These factors include climate variables (rainfall, OLR), horizontal advection, and surface fluxes (net terrestrial exchange and combustion emissions). During the Indian monsoon period, a notable decrease in atmospheric CO 2 concentration is observed, attributed to factors such as marine transport driven by the southwest monsoon and low-level cross-equatorial flow, coupled with active vegetation engaging in photosynthetic activities. In contrast, the pre-monsoon season shows elevated CO 2 levels across all regions due to suppressed vegetation growth, crop harvesting, and extensive biomass burning amid prevailing dry conditions. Moderate CO 2 levels are recorded during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, driven by CO 2 fixation by winter crops and the continuous influence of anthropogenic emissions. A multiple linear regression model was employed to determine regional relationships between atmospheric CO 2 and its potential influencing factors throughout different seasons. The seasonal cycles of CO 2 derived from our regression model align well with satellite measurements and NOAA CarbonTracker data. To strengthen validation, we compared model outputs with in-situ CO 2 measurements from four flux tower locations (Gadanki, Sriharikota, Shadnagar, and Ponmudi). These comparisons demonstrate good alignment, reinforcing the model’s robustness in capturing regional CO 2 dynamics. A significant portion of seasonal CO 2 variability can be explained by vegetation dynamics and anthropogenic activities. Additionally, intense convective activities and rainfall are identified as key contributors to the seasonal dynamics of atmospheric CO 2 ."

    "abstract": "Arunachal Pradesh, located in northeastern India, is a region prone to earthquakes due to tectonic movements from the Himalayan collision zone and the Indo-Myanmar subduction zone. This study presents a comprehensive seismic hazard analysis of Arunachal Pradesh, employing updated earthquake data and a logic tree approach. Earthquake data from multiple sources and fault parameters from the seismotectonic atlas were analyzed. Seismicity parameters and maximum magnitude are estimated for each source. Utilizing both deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) methods, peak ground acceleration (PGA) values were calculated for various districts, identifying critical faults contributing to seismic activity. Uniform hazard spectra (acceleration, velocity, displacement) were developed, and seismic hazard curves and maps were generated for each district of Arunachal Pradesh to illustrate varying levels of seismic risk. The results show that the peak ground acceleration (PGA) values range from 0.42 to 1.08g in the DSHA method, 0.22–0.49 for DBE (design basis earthquake – 475 yr), and 0.42–1.08g for MCE (maximum considered earthquake – 2475 yr) recurrence interval in the PSHA method, significantly exceeding IS 1893:2016 standards. Sagaing, Lohit, Sylhet, and Samin Faults are identified as critical seismic sources, with West Kameng, Namsai, Lohit, and Lower Dibang Valley at the highest risk. Pushover analysis reveals that seismic demands exceed Indian standards by up to 105%, emphasizing the need for revised design parameters. The findings align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), emphasizing resilient infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and policy collaboration to enhance seismic safety in high-risk areas. The results underscore the necessity for updated seismic design codes to ensure structures can withstand the identified seismic risks effectively."

    "title": "Integrating statistical metrics and spatial network analysis for a multi-scale climate model evaluation",
    "abstract": "General Circulation Models (GCMs) are essential tools for assessing climate change, but it is critical to evaluate their performance to identify suitable models for regional-scale hydrological applications. This study evaluates 34 CMIP6 GCMs from the NEX-GDDP archive to select climate models for climate change impact assessment for the state of Kerala, India, by examining monthly precipitation data across the 86 grids that cover the state. The climate models are analysed for their macro-scale performance using a network analysis approach and for their micro-scale performance using a statistical index-based ranking approach. The macro-scale approach focuses on spatial synchrony of climate variables to look at the performance of the climate models across the spatial domain using network-derived indicators. The micro-scale approach focuses on the temporal performance of the climate models across the different grids. The present study generates a combined ranking based on both the schemes. A pool of 16 GCMs was identified by combining the top 10 models from the macro-scale and micro-scale selection approaches, with ACCESS-ESM1-5, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, CMCC-CM2-SR5 and TaiESM1 consistently ranking top across both methods. To remove interdependent models from the ensemble, interdependency measures like transfer entropy, mutual information and Pearson’s correlation were employed on area-weighted average precipitation data from the climate models. A maximum relevant, minimum redundant ensemble was identified for Kerala, containing the models: MIROC-6, INM-CM4-08, EC-Earth3-Veg-LR and HadGEM3-GC31-MM. Historical simulations of rainfall from the selected models show correlation greater than 0.6 with historical observed rainfall over most of the grids in Kerala, with lower correlations towards the Western Ghats region in Kerala. The statistical properties of the observed rainfall like monsoon mean, coefficient of variation, 95 th percentile rainfall and highest consecutive dry days are also simulated well in these selected models."

    "title": "Spatiotemporal analysis of NO2 trends over major air pollution hotspots in India using Sentinel-5P",
    "abstract": "Air pollution remains one of the most critical environmental challenges globally, adversely affecting human health and ecosystem stability. In India, the burden is intensified by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and seasonal agricultural practices. Previous research often overlooked long-term, high-resolution spatiotemporal assessments of NO 2 concentration trends, especially across major pollution hotspots. This study analyzes detailed NO 2 patterns from 2019 to 2023 over three key hotspots identified using binary classification of the Sentinel-5P-derived mean NO 2 spatial distribution map: Hotspot-1 (Sonbhadra–Singrauli–Balrampur), Hotspot-2 (Korba–Bilaspur–Janjgir-Champa), and Hotspot-3 (Delhi NCR). Various advanced statistical parameters were employed to assess distinct spatiotemporal patterns and uncover dynamic emission patterns. Hotspot-1 exhibited the highest peak NO 2 value of 4.248 × 10 −4 mol/m 2 in 2019, with a persistent annual mean around 2.1–2.2 × 10 −4 mol/m 2 , and sharp seasonal peaks (e.g., May 2023: 2.93, Dec 2021 and 2022: 3.08). Hotspot-2 showed a gradual rise in mean NO 2 from 1.831 × 10 −4 in 2019 to 1.967 × 10 −4 in 2023, with a maximum of 3.68 × 10 −4 in 2023, indicating steady industrial activity. Monthly peaks include Dec 2023: 3.07 and Nov 2022: 2.50. In contrast, Hotspot-3 recorded comparatively lower values, with a maximum of 2.459 × 10 −4 in 2021 and relatively stable mean levels (~1.83–1.88 × 10 −4 ), despite sharp monthly spikes such as Jan 2023: 2.95 and Dec 2023: 2.74. While Hotspots 1 and 2 show strong pre- and post-monsoon variations linked to industrial output, Hotspot-3 exhibits more fluctuation in winter months due to urban emissions and meteorological trapping effects. Notably, Hotspot-1 experienced the steepest drop (−0.95 in Jun–Jul 2023), and Hotspot-3 recorded the sharpest monthly rise (+0.87 in Nov–Dec 2023), highlighting dynamic pollution regimes across the regions. Overall, findings highlight the need for region- and season-specific mitigation policies. The outcomes also support data-driven strategies for improving public health and guiding national air quality management initiatives."

    "abstract": "Abstract Nowcasting of North Eastern Himalayan orographic rainfall has been attempted using ground-based Doppler weather radar reflectivity echo information for more than 532 samples covering various rain events of the year 2023 over two densely populated hilly Indian locations, Agartala and Mohanbari. Various optical motion fields of rain are used as input to the nowcasting algorithm. Both ensemble and non-ensemble-based nowcasting algorithms have been used, and performances have been considered. Lead time of nowcast has been increased from half an hour to two hours. The performance analysis shows that there are significant seasonal and locational variations with respect to the statistical error parameter and contingency error parameter. With an increase in lead time, performance skill decreases. Use of a short-term ensemble prediction system in nowcasting with ensemble size varying from 24 to 72 does not indicate any significant improvement in performance. Detailed performance analysis of the algorithms will help in the efficient, targeted use of a suitable rain nowcasting algorithm for operational purposes. Research highlights Nowcasting of orographic rain with Doppler Weather Radar reflectivity echo. Prediction using optical motion field of rain. Both ensemble and non-ensemble-based algorithm have been used for nowcasting. Prediction performance and skill score have been compared for orographic rain."

    "title": "Effect of basin geometry in seismic wave amplification",
    "abstract": "Sedimentary basins have long been recognised as amplifiers of earthquake ground motions, contributing to severe damage in events like the 1985 Mexico City, 1994 Northridge, and 1995 Kobe earthquakes. Amplification arises from impedance contrasts between sediment layers, which can trap seismic energy during an earthquake. This energy leads to multiple reflections, refractions, and long-period reverberations that significantly influence the resulting ground motion. The present study focuses on analysing the effect of the geometry of sedimentary basins on seismic wave propagation and amplification. We have used a two-dimensional spectral element simulation to model the problem. The numerical models have a half-elastic medium considering P-SV waves and utilise idealised basin shapes to examine the effects of basin geometry and material properties. Here we investigate the time domain response, frequency domain response, and velocity response spectra of the ground motions simulated at various basin cross sections, such as rectangular, trapezoidal, parabolic and foreland basins. Also, the amplification of ground motions is analysed with respect to the depth of the basin, distance from the epicentre, and frequency for the different basin geometry models. The results demonstrated that the geometry of the basin has a significant impact on seismic wave amplification, both in terms of the amplitude and the duration of the waves. Also, to understand the seismic wavefield generated at a real-world basin site, ground motions are simulated at the Indo-Gangetic basin by considering the best-known material properties and basin structure. The results indicate that the long-period surface waves have relatively more amplitude and duration compared to the stations outside the basin. Additionally, it has been noted that basin stations situated further from the edges of the basin exhibit heightened surface wave activity in the 2D simulation. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the pronounced basin-edge effect evident in the 2D simulation."

    "abstract": "Field and petrographic evidences from the Vempalle Formation of the Cuddapah basin suggest that talc can form by replacing host rock dolomite. Here, we present a mass balance calculation, based on volume, for the replacement of host rock dolomite by talc. The volume-conservative replacement process is thought to be driven by the crystallisation stress that develops during the growth of talc within the rigid host. The crystallization stress induced during talc-for-dolomite replacement can exceed the direct tensile strength and uniaxial compressive strength of dolomite, potentially creating micro-fractures that cross-cut primary stratification, promote fluid migration and subsequent talc mineralization. The fluid influx required to complete talc mineralization in dolomite hosts is substantial (approximately 1.32 × l0 6 L for the complete replacement of 1 m 3 of dolomite) and is consistent with the findings from other independent studies. Model results suggest that talcification of dolomite depends on temperature, reactive surface area, saturation of fluid with respect to talc, and host rock porosity."

    "title": "New paleomagnetic data from the Ladakh Molasse Group provide a Late Oligocene (26.5 Ma) age for the first post India–Asia collision continental sediments: Biostratigraphic implications",
    "abstract": "Abstract Being a part of the Indus Tsangpo Suture Zone (ITSZ), the Ladakh Molasse Group can provide important information about the first continental sedimentation in the India–Asia collision zone. Despite previous biochronological attempts, the age of the Ladakh Molasse Group has not been constrained precisely, which makes the existing palaeontological, palaeoecological, and stratigraphic data difficult to correlate at the regional and subcontinental levels. Although magnetostratigraphic studies can facilitate constraining the age, till date, such studies have been conducted in the eastern and central parts of the Ladakh Molasse Group only. Here we present the first paleomagnetic study of the Western Ladakh Molasse Group, providing a precise age for the base of this group by integrating Late Oligocene biostratigraphic marker rodent and tragulid taxa known from paleomagnetically dated Chitarwata Formation of Pakistan. Our interpretation indicates an age of 26.5 Ma, Late Oligocene (Chattian) for the base of the Kargil Formation, the timing of the first influx of continental sediment in Kargil (Western Ladakh), and a better correlation of the Kargil section to those of the Basgo and Zanskar Gorge. Our Gas Bench-IRMS stable carbon and oxygen isotope data support earlier Laser Ablation IRMS-based results suggesting a C3 dominant diet and a subtropical to temperate forest habitat for the tragulid Nalameryx savagei . Research highlights This study represents the first paleomagnetic investigation of the Ladakh Molasse Group, suggesting that post-collisional continental sedimentation in Western Ladakh commenced around 26.5 million years ago, during the Late Oligocene. Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the region indicates that Ladakh once resembled a subtropical forest, characterized by a warm and humid climate, in stark contrast to its current cold and dry conditions. The forested environment was home to a diverse range of fauna and flora. The mammalian taxa found in Kargil, which are significant for biochronological analysis, support a Late Oligocene age for the formation."

    "abstract": "The Indian Himalayan region is prone to frequent and highly vulnerable landslides due to a combination of geo-environmental, anthropogenic, and climate-related factors. Pithoragarh district, located in the Kumaon Himalaya, exhibits a variety of factors ideal for landslides. The present study deals with the preparation of a landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) map of the Pithoragarh district using three statistical models. The thirteen causative factors such as slope angle, aspect, elevation, plan curvature, profile curvature, lithology, topographic wetness index (TWI), land use land cover (LULC), distance to road, distance to drainage, distance to thrust, soil texture, and rainfall were found to influence the landslide occurrences in the study area and subsequent thematic layers were prepared. Using Bhukosh inventory data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, a landslide inventory map was created. One thousand six hundred twenty-five landslides have been divided into training dataset (70%) and testing dataset (30%). Consequently, three statistical, frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), and weight of evidence (WoE), were utilized within a GIS platform to integrate essential influencing factors with the landslide inventory to generate LSZ maps. The LSZ maps categorized the study area into five different classes, such as very low, low, medium, high, and very high, according to the degree of landslide susceptibility. It was found from the LSZ maps that about 31.93–37.84% (31.93% in the FR, 36.854% in the WoE, and 37.841% in the IV-based LSZ map) of the Pithoragarh district falls under very high and high landslide susceptibility zones. Based on the area under the curve value, the IV model was found to provide a higher success rate and prediction rate than the other two employed models."

    "abstract": "The flood disasters are prevalent in the Ganga–Brahmaputra (GB) basin with recurrent occurrences and severe impacts across the major watersheds. The present study analyses the vulnerability of 44 watersheds to flood inundation and its impact on cropland, urban areas, and population. The Sentinel-1 dataset was utilised to analyse flood extent and frequency from 2015 to 2022, enabling the identification of flood-prone watersheds in the Ganga–Brahmaputra basin. The analysis revealed that 7 watersheds in the Ganga basin and 12 watersheds in the Brahmaputra basin are particularly vulnerable to flooding. The flood hazard analysis was performed using fuzzy-AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), focusing on six parameters, including topographic wetness index (TWI), elevation, precipitation, drainage density, distance from river, and NDVI for the selected 19 watersheds. The inundation analysis from 2015 to 2022 revealed that the maximum flood extent was observed in 2020, with an affected area of 33,537.6 km 2 and 34,937.9 km 2 in the Ganga–Brahmaputra basin, respectively. The flood hazard analysis identified Upper Ganga (8877.52 km 2 ), Ghaghara (18573.9 km 2 ) and Teesta (1543.06 km 2 ) as having the highest proportion of their geographical area under very high-hazard zone and the highest percentage in the very low hazard zones were observed in Jamuneshwary (1093.55 km 2 ), Atreyee (4410.42 km 2 ), and Kulsi (1273.89 km 2 ). By first mapping these watersheds with precision and then using various parameters for flood hazard analysis, it ensures accurate identification of flood-prone areas, offering valuable insights for flood management and mitigation in a critical region."

    "title": "3D crustal S-wave velocity structure beneath the NE Tibetan Plateau constrained by receiver function and deep seismic sounding data",
    "abstract": "Abstract The northeastern Tibetan Plateau’s crustal structure remains poorly constrained, hindering our understanding of its tectonic evolution. To resolve uncertainties in the crustal structure of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, a region critical for understanding continental deformation and tectonic evolution, this study integrates teleseismic receiver function inversion and deep seismic sounding (DSS) data to construct a high-resolution 3D S-wave velocity model that clarifies these uncertainties and offers new insights into the tectonic processes shaping the region. Key findings include: (1) Lateral heterogeneity: Pronounced velocity variations between tectonic blocks, with the Ordos and Alax blocks exhibiting stable, high-velocity crust, while orogens (Qilian, East Kunlun, and West Qinling) show low velocities and widespread low-velocity zones (LVZs). (2) Crustal thickening: Stepwise thickening from west to east, with the Qilian orogen reaching 60 km, while the West Qinling orogen thins to ~51 km. (3) LVZ distribution: Discontinuous LVZs beneath orogens, challenging the lower crustal flow model and supporting horizontal shortening as the primary deformation mechanism. These results provide critical insights into the crustal dynamics of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, highlighting the role of lateral heterogeneity and LVZ distribution in controlling crustal deformation.

    "abstract": "An integrated sedimentological and ichnological analysis of the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sediments of the Middle Jurassic Bada Bag Member of the Jaisalmer Formation indicates deposition in a subtidal to intertidal paleoenvironment. Four distinct facies were identified – (i) fossiliferous silty limestone, (ii) tidally influenced sandstone–mudstone heteroliths, (iii) lensoidal conglomerate, and (iv) cross-stratified silty limestone. The vertical repetition of the facies types reflect systematic change in hydrodynamic conditions. The succession contains diverse ichnoassemblages, including Asteriacites stelliformis , Cochlichnus isp . , Palaeophycus tubularis , Taenidium isp . , and Thalassinoides isp., representing varied ethological behaviours of invertebrate trace-makers. The ichnogenus Asteriacites von Schlotheim, 1820 is identified within the silty limestone facies and, based on morphological and morphometric parameters, is assigned to ichnospecies Asteriacites stelliformis (Miller and Dyer 1878; Osgood 1970). Varied ecological parameters controlled the ethological responses of the organisms, influencing the trace fossil distribution and assemblages, resulting in the development of Cruziana ichnofacies . A gradual increase in tidal influence and a decline in detrital sediment input toward the upper part of the succession corresponds with the dominance of deposit-feeding ichnotaxa in fine-grained sediments. Overall, the sedimentary architecture and ichnological record reflect alternating low to moderate-energy subtidal and high-energy intertidal conditions during the deposition of the Middle Jurassic Bada Bag Member."

    "title": "Subsurface investigation and statistical relation using SPT-N values and shear wave velocity for Jamshedpur, India",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the present work, Jamshedpur city, Jharkhand, India, situated within a significant portion of the Chotanagpur plateau, has been chosen to examine the subsurface profiles and variation of shear wave velocity through a geotechnical and geophysical investigation process. Geophysical investigation using MASW testing was conducted at 33 different locations across the study area to estimate the shear wave velocity profiles and depth of subsurface layers. Geotechnical investigation was performed involving the drilling of 37 boreholes across 25 distinct locations to acquire SPT-N values at various depths and to analyze the subsurface soil profiles. Based on the results, it has been observed that the depth of subsurface layers obtained from the MASW survey and the soil strata identified from the borehole data show a very close resemblance for almost all survey locations within the study region. A new empirical correlation between shear wave velocity (SWV), V s and uncorrected standard penetration resistance ( SPT-N ) values has been proposed using 21 relatively closed-spaced MASW and SPT-N tests using nonlinear regression analysis. The proposed correlation has been validated to employ the prediction capability of the proposed relation based on statistical assessment, graphical methods, and comparison with existing correlations. It has been seen that about 85% V s values obtained from proposed correlation were predicted within 10% error of margin, indicating a better estimation of the proposed relation. The proposed relation can be recommended for soil profile study, dynamic site response assessment, and site characterization for the entire Chotanagpur plateau region and can be compared to measure V s . Article Highlights We have conducted a detailed study for Jamshedpur city, India using both geotechnical (37 boreholes) and geophysical (33 MASW) investigation to assess subsurface profiles and shear wave velocity variations. We have proposed a novel empirical correlation between shear wave velocity (V s ) and uncorrected SPT-N values, based on 21 closely-spaced MASW and borehole tests. The proposed correlation has been validated to employ the prediction capability of the proposed relation based on statistical assessment, graphical methods, and comparison with existing correlations. The proposed correlation is recommended for soil profile study, dynamic site response assessment, and site characterization across the Chotanagpur plateau region, offering a valuable tool for measuring V s ."

    "abstract": "We report probably the second/third possible occurrence of the world and the first occurrence of natural graphene in India associated with graphite from the Paleoproterozoic Bhukia gold deposit, western India. Gold occurs in both native and lattice-bound invisible forms, closely associated with graphite and natural graphene. Graphene–graphite–gold interface is spatially and temporally associated with pyrrhotite, pyrite, magnetite, tourmaline and carbonates. Albitite and dolomitic marble predominantly host gold+graphite mineralization along with naturally occurring graphene, which is very rare in nature as most of the graphene so far obtained or recovered is in synthesized form except their natural occurrences in the Coosa provinces in Alabama, USA; Sheba Gold mine in Barberton area, South Africa and in the ancient meteorites. Two types of graphitic phases are found in the mineralizing system: (i) as flaky sheet-like and (ii) as lath-shaped along with graphene. Distribution patterns and association of the graphite+graphene grains with sulfides suggest possible hydrothermal precipitation of the graphite, which is coeval with gold mineralization and has a primordial biogenic precursor. Presence of naturally occurring graphene may throw some light on the evolution of life during Precambrian time, and also for understanding the hitherto lesser known high-technology carbonic phases."

    "title": "Assessing the impact of climate change and glacier retreat on sea level rise, coastal ecosystems, and vulnerable communities",
    "abstract": "The swift withdrawal of glaciers as a result of climate change is one of the major drivers of surging global sea levels, affecting coastal ecosystems and vulnerable populations. Building upon satellite data, climate models and socio-economic analysis, this study contributes to the prediction of glacier mass loss, sea level rise and potential socio-economic implications. The models were on average 92% accurate in predicting which glaciers would lose mass and predicted that by 2050, the average world sea level would be an average of 0.3 m higher than today. It also forecasts major disruptions to coastal ecosystems, including the loss of more than 30% of mangrove forests in Southeast Asia and 25% of coastal wetlands by 2050. Examples of socio-economic impact are a 20% reduction in glacier meltwater availability in the Himalayas, threatening water security to millions, and risks of displacement in areas like Bangladesh and the Maldives. The economic toll of those impacts could total over $1 trillion per year worldwide by 2100. The study highlights the importance of integrated modelling to evaluate the multidimensional impact of glacier retreat, as such work provides vital information on the joint environmental and socio-economic risks that climate change presents."

    "title": "Emergence of mixoplanktonic dinoflagellates in the Eastern Arabian Sea: An annotated checklist",
    "abstract": "Abstract Dinoflagellates are highly studied groups of protists in marine ecosystems as food for metazoan grazers and as harmful algal bloom-forming species. The recent emergence of the mixoplankton paradigm sees photo-phago-osmo-mixotrophic protists recognized as important communities in marine ecosystems akin to phytoplankton and zooplankton. The present study aims to reappraise the functional group classification of the Arabian Sea dinoflagellates and provide a checklist specifically focussing on the mixoplankton functional type – constitutive mixoplankton (CM, inherent capability for phototrophy) and non-constitutive mixoplankton (NCM, phototrophy acquired from prey) and also their harmful algal bloom (HAB) status. We focussed on three major productive areas of the Arabian Sea: South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS), North Eastern Arabian Sea (NEAS), and Lakshadweep Sea (LS). Our study identified 35 dinoflagellate species, whereas 26 were HAB species. The highest number of species was observed in the family Dinophysaceae, which has eight species. Among the 35 identified mixoplanktonic dinoflagellates, the majority were CM (24 spp.). Understanding mixotrophy is important in interpreting the evidence of climatic fluctuations in marine organisms, with mixoplankton shifting towards phagotrophy. Thus, this study provides the foundation for future studies on mixoplanktonic dinoflagellates, particularly for potentially harmful species with possible repercussions to climate change. Research highlights A checklist for mixotrophic dinoflagellates along the Eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) was constructed. Thirty-five species corresponding to 18 genera, 14 families, and 8 orders were recorded among which 26 were HAB species. Family Dinophysaceae was the diverse one with 8 spp., followed by Ceratiaceae with 7 spp. The checklist provides baseline information for future mixotrophic dinoflagellate studies along EAS."

    "title": "Seismic assessment of Itanagar city, Arunachal Pradesh, India: ELGRA studies incorporating spatially variable subsurface stratification derived from active MASW survey",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the seismic response of 22 selected locations across the Itanagar region using equivalent linear ground response analysis (ELGRA). The analysis incorporates shear wave velocity data obtained from active multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) field tests as input parameters for ELGRA. Four distinct acceleration–time histories were used as strong motion inputs to consider a wide range of peak bedrock acceleration (PBA) ranging from 0.026 to 0.82 g. The results reveal the significant spatial variability in ground response parameters such as peak ground acceleration (PGA), amplification factor, displacement, shear strain, spectral acceleration (SA), and shear stress ratio profiles. The surface PGA in the Itanagar city is found to be within the range of 0.064–1.71 g, along with the amplification factors varying between 0.4 and 11. For motions with PBA more than 0.343 g, a few locations in the city exhibited deamplification as well, thereby lowering the influence of the higher seismic energy imparted by the chosen motion. The study successfully highlights the variability of peak spectral acceleration (PSA) in the region, especially identifying the locations manifesting higher magnitudes of PSA. The identified period bandwidths at different locations of high PSA (0.05–0.2 sec for lower PBA motions and 0.2–0.4 sec for higher PBA motions) indicate the potential vulnerability of infrastructures with approximately similar natural periods. The variability of spectral acceleration within the region corresponding to the periods of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 sec clearly demarcated the locations where buildings with specific heights would be subjected to higher seismic forces. This study provides valuable insights into the seismic response of the Itanagar region, highlighting the importance of site-specific geological conditions in influencing ground motion amplification. The findings of this analysis can be efficiently utilized to develop seismic resilient structures and enhance seismic risk management strategies in the region."

    "abstract": "This study integrates local site effects and land use land cover dynamics using advanced statistical and machine learning methods into the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) framework for assessing the seismic hazard of Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, Peninsular India. An updated homogenized earthquake catalogue spanning from 1800 to 2023 AD, around a 400 km radius from Prakasam district, was considered for the analysis. A seismotectonic map was developed incorporating regional geology, past seismicity, and geological discontinuities that are capable of producing significant ground motion. Seismic source zones were delineated, and seismicity parameters were quantified using a Gutenberg–Richter recurrence model. Ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) were ranked based on their alignment with recorded ground motion data using the log-likelihood (LLH) method. Spatial variations in hazard, expressed in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA), were determined for return periods of 475 and 2475 yr. Surface-level PGA values for the study area ranged from 0.097 to 0.277 g for the 475-yr return period and from 0.233 to 0.539 g for the 2475-yr return period. Uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) for significant locations in Prakasam district was plotted and compared with IS 1893 (Part 1): 2016 codal provisions. Land use and land cover change detection from 2001 to 2024 was performed utilizing satellite images via supervised classifiers such as maximum likelihood (ML), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). Finally, an integrated land use and seismic hazard map was developed, offering valuable insights for urban planners, insurance companies, and policymakers. The outcomes of the present study aid in earthquake hazard mitigation efforts by facilitating informed decision-making and planning of resilient infrastructure."

    "title": "Coupled effects of ionic strength and flow velocity on colloid transport in saturated porous media",
    "abstract": "Abstract The extent of groundwater pollution due to colloids can be assessed using formulas that can estimate colloid deposition parameters in terms of various physicochemical conditions. Ionic strength and pore-water velocity are known to affect colloid transport and retention significantly. This study deals with understanding the synergetic effects of ionic strength and pore-water velocity on particle deposition for a wide range of ionic strengths (0–100 mM) and pore-water velocities (0.55–11 cm/min) through column experiments and mathematical modelling. Colloid retention increased with decreasing pore-water velocity and increasing ionic strength. However, the effect of increasing pore-water velocity on reducing colloid retention increased with increasing ionic strength. In contrast, the effect of increasing ionic strength on enhancing colloid retention was found to decrease with increasing pore-water velocity. Breakthrough curves exhibited significant tailing at pore-water velocities of 0.55 and 2.75 cm/min, representing slow detachment. Colloid deposition was found to be irreversible, and colloids were observed to be retained in the concave regions on grain surface at pore-water velocities of 5.5 and 11 cm/min. A mathematical model consisting of two sites, one characterized by equilibrium and the other being a kinetic one, was found to simulate the experimental data reasonably well. Further, formulas were developed for the attachment and detachment rate coefficients of colloids in terms of ionic strength and pore-water velocity. Research Highlights Coupled effects of ionic strength and pore-water velocity on colloid transport were studied under a broad range of ionic strengths and pore-water velocities. Two-site sorption model, with site-1 being an equilibrium site and site-2 being a kinetic site, successfully fitted the experimental results. Ionic strength played a dominant role in colloid retention at low velocities and pore-water velocity significantly influenced colloid transport at high ionic strengths. Formulas were developed for the attachment and detachment rate coefficients of colloids vis-à-vis ionic strength and pore-water velocity."

    "title": "Phenology of coastal upwelling in the Southeastern Arabian Sea: Insights from in-situ and satellite observations",
    "abstract": "Abstract The marine ecosystem responses in the Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) during the summer monsoon are mainly regulated by the periodic cycle (phenology) of coastal upwelling, which varies spatially and temporally. Hydrography associated with the initial phase of upwelling during different years was studied using in-situ and satellite observations. The research further investigated the relative contributions of wind-driven and remotely forced upwelling. Offshore Ekman transport and local temperature anomaly are significantly correlated for the coastal region from the Cape (8°N) to Mangalore (13°N). The upwelling phenology was addressed in terms of the dates of onset, withdrawal, amplitude, and duration of the process. Daily climatological patterns indicated a latitudinal gradient in upwelling, with southern latitudes (8–9°N) exhibiting earlier, longer, and more consistent upwelling. Meanwhile, northern latitudes (12–13°N) had a delay in onset, shorter duration, and increased variability. The study also examined interannual variability in upwelling onset, withdrawal, and duration, highlighting the sensitivity of upwelling systems to climatic events. Extreme climatic events such as El Niño in 2015 were associated with a delayed upwelling onset and short duration, while a strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in 2019 caused early cessation at north of 10°N. The Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration was also decreased notably during those periods, reflecting reduced upwelling strength. However, the La Niña/negative IOD events in 2016 prolonged the upwelling season, especially between 9 and 11°N. The derived relationship between upwelling and biological productivity is reflected in the strong coupling between upwelling indices and Chl-a. Trend analysis showed a warming trend, along with a decreasing trend in Chl-a. Despite a weakening in wind-driven coastal upwelling, the negative sea surface temperature trend observed off the southern tip of India suggests complex sub-surface processes that may counteract the warming trend. The present study defines and details the phenology of coastal upwelling in the SEAS that determines the onset-withdrawal timing, intensity, amplitude, duration, etc., and the impacts of teleconnections. Research highlights Phenology of coastal upwelling in the SEAS is detailed through daily climatological patterns, and interannual variability is also studied. Wind-driven upwelling is higher at Tvpm, while remote forcing plays a significant role at Kollam and Kochi. El Niño (2015), positive IOD (2019), and La Niña/negative IOD (2016) modulate upwelling timing, intensity, and Chl-a concentrations. Long-term trends indicate a warming of 0.02°C per year, a decline in Chl-a of 0.01 mg/m³ per year, and a decrease in wind-driven coastal upwelling."

    "title": "Revisiting the tropical cyclone genesis potential index for the Bay of Bengal post-monsoon season",
    "abstract": "Bay of Bengal (BoB) is known to host intense tropical cyclones (TCs). The accurate determination of BoB cyclogenesis remains a challenge for the scientific community. Detailed assessment of existing genesis potential indices (GPI) reveals their inability to replicate the variability of TC frequency in the BoB. This study developed a GPI (nGPI), which displays better/equal skill in estimating TC genesis despite using less number of variables compared to the existing GPIs. The nGPI has significantly higher skill in capturing the interannual variability of TC frequency as compared to the most previously developed GPI during the 1993–2022 post-monsoon season. Our analysis further reveals that the dominant contribution to the interannual variability in the GPI comes from the mid-level relative humidity (~44%) and the low-level relative vorticity (~39%). The contribution of tropical cyclone heat potential is ~17%. The nGPI exhibits higher values when the number of observed TCs is higher and vice versa for a lower number of TCs. Further, our analysis reveals that the dynamic parameters have a limited role in governing the interannual variability of TC frequency in the BoB during the post-monsoon season. This study thus advocates the use of nGPI for future TC simulation/projection studies using CMIP models, where the availability of high-resolution parameters at multiple pressure levels is often limited. Furthermore, this newly developed GPI can serve as a reliable proxy for projecting TC frequency under various climate scenarios over the BoB during the post-monsoon season."

    "title": "Effect of fluid–rock interaction on the geomechanical attributes of sandstones from Ib Valley in Odisha, India",
    "abstract": "Geo-sequestration of CO 2 is a key climate change mitigation technology witnessing rapid scale-up across the globe. With the potential to store CO 2 for thousands of years, deep saline aquifers are considered highly favourable, where the rock–brine–CO 2 interaction controls the effectiveness of the geo-sequestration. There are limited studies on the mechanical behaviour of sandstone saturated with brine solution of different salinity in the context of variable depths. Herein, with detailed experimentation, the influence of brine concentration was studied on the geomechanical properties of sandstone from Ib Valley coalfield in Odisha from three different depth ranges (100–150, 400–450, 800–850 m) belonging to different formations such as Kamthi Formation, Barakar Formation and Talchir Formation, respectively, of the Gondwana Supergroup. The effect of salinity on the mechanical properties of sandstones was investigated through a series of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and tensile strength tests with varying NaCl brine concentrations (5%, 15% and 25%). Furthermore, petrographic thin section and XRD analysis were performed to understand the mineralogical characteristics of the sandstone. The microstructural and compositional changes in sandstone were studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results reveal that depth, depositional environment, and brine concentration influence the strength and deformation attributes of the sandstones. Splitting longitudinal fracture with some shear component was the dominant failure mode. The dry samples showed higher UCS and elastic modulus than the saturated samples at specific depths. The samples saturated with higher NaCl concentrations (15% and 25%) had relatively higher UCS values and elastic modulus values than the lower concentration. Concentrated salt solutions can promote the precipitation of salt crystals within pore spaces, which may reinforce the rock matrix by partially clogging pores and increasing effective cohesion."

    "abstract": "Reservoir sands deposited in a deltaic environment are normally associated with point bars, crevasse splays, and distributary mouth bars, which often shale out over short distances. In a strati-structural entrapment situation, understanding the geometry and characteristics of these reservoir sands becomes important for the placement of future exploratory wells. The East Godavari sub-basin is characterized by growth fault-related rollover structures that were formed during Paleogene–Neogene times in a deltaic environment. The study area involves a gas-bearing structure, wherein a well with thick sands of over 50 m at Lower Eocene level shales out to a couple of meters in another well located about a kilometer west of it. Gas is discovered at different sand levels. The present study aims to understand the distribution of these sands with respect to the facies changes and reservoir distribution. Structural mapping was carried out in a 3D seismic volume for two pay-sand levels in Lower Eocene after integrating with well logs. Instantaneous and geometric attributes were extracted and analyzed. Instantaneous bandwidth, a transmissive attribute that relates to various physical conditions in the sub-surface, has clearly brought out the channel complex. These sub-aqueous channels appear to change their course frequently due to sedimentary influx and are the primary reason for not finding channel cut features in the amplitude data. The instantaneous bandwidth attribute highlights the varying absorption characteristics along the channel. Areas that show higher absorption characteristics, indicating high porosity and high fluid saturation, have to be seen in conjunction with contact limits within the structure to find better locales for hydrocarbon exploration."

    "abstract": "Viruses play a critical role in microbial communities and biogeochemical cycles, yet they remain underexplored in many environments. Coastal sediments, particularly in beach ecosystems, are essential in regulating microbial populations, influencing nutrient cycling, and facilitating ecological interactions between terrestrial and marine systems. This study employed metagenomic approaches and whole-genome sequencing to investigate the viral community in coastal sediments along the Kerala coast, Southern India, revealing ~40 viral families. Among the most abundant were the newly described Schitoviridae family and Vibriophages , with one particular operational taxonomic unit (OTU) dominating the community. Despite the high viral richness, the community exhibited low evenness, with implications for the structure and function of the viral community. The study also highlighted the ecological significance of giant viruses and their potential roles in marine ecosystems. Some viral groups were linked to terrestrial sources, illustrating the interconnectedness of marine and terrestrial viral populations. Furthermore, a complete genome sequence of Vibriophage was generated, adding to the growing catalogue of marine viral genomes. This investigation provides a foundational understanding of viral diversity in coastal ecosystems and establishes a baseline for future research on the ecological roles of viruses. It underscores the need for further exploration of unexplored viral communities in coastal sediments, which could enhance our understanding of viral ecology and their impact on ecosystem dynamics."

    "abstract": "This research is designed to improve bi-monthly and seasonal rainfall predictions in Ethiopia during the Kiremt season (June–September), which is critical for agriculture. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) forecasting models are used in this study. Monthly rainfall data or Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) and four predictors SST3.4, ERA5 total precipitation, and zonal wind data at the 850 and 200 mb levels from 1990 to 2020 are used to improve rainfall forecasting. The model performance was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), bias percentage calculation (PBIAS), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ). The MLR and NARX models explained 87 and 86% of the variance in rainfall data, respectively. The spatial averages of RMSE and MAE are 17.1 and 14.1 units, respectively. The models performed variably across stations and time periods, with the NARX model proving more accurate at select sites and during wet seasons, while MLR produced more consistent findings in other regions. Both models performed well in predicting rainfall on a seasonal and bi-monthly basis. The findings help to improve Ethiopian agricultural planning, hydrological management, and early warning systems."

    "abstract": "Abstract The present study documents a continental (fluvial) to marine (tidal) transition from the Paleoproterozoic Rautgara Formation, Damtha Group, ILH. An unconfined sandy braided channel system, akin to the ‘sheetflood distal braided’ system, represents the Rautgara fluvial system with flashy discharge and occasional hyperconcentrated flow. The Rautgara coastline was tide dominated. Bidirectional heterolithic cross-strata, mud drapes on cross-strata foreset, double mud drapes and sandy rhythmites bear tell-tale signatures of tidal operation. The present study could document the presence of a tidal channel (point bar deposit) and tidal transverse bar (isolated and amalgamated) in a subtidal setting; transverse bars are noticed in both top-truncated and full-vortex forms. From dominant lithology and the presence of decimetre-scale cross-stratifications, the tidal system is identified as sandy and macrotidal. From the measurement of laminae thickness, the tidal setting is identified as diurnal in character. A relative rise in bathymetry and progressive deepening is inferred from documentation of the facies stacking pattern in the studied section; only the uppermost part records shallowing.

    "title": "The effects of azimuthal coverage and velocity model on the moment tensor inversions of light earthquakes",
    "abstract": "The success of the well-known and widely used focal mechanism determination methods (the first motion polarities of the P waves and S-to-P amplitude ratio methods) depends on good azimuthal coverage and waveforms with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Although the number of seismic stations is relatively high today, seismological networks are sparse in some regions, and it is not always possible to obtain waveforms with a high signal-to-noise ratio, especially for small earthquakes. These limitations hinder polarity–amplitude readings and the ability to achieve good azimuthal coverage. In these cases, the moment tensor inversion method can be used as an alternative to these methods. Thanks to the method that uses the entire waveform, focal mechanisms of earthquakes can be determined without polarity or amplitude readings. This case study aims to shed light on moment tensor solutions of small earthquakes by examining the effects of azimuthal coverage and velocity models on the moment tensor solutions of light earthquakes. For this purpose, five selected light earthquakes that occurred in the Marmara Region were used for analysis. The Marmara region and these earthquakes were chosen because the focal mechanism parameters of the earthquakes are well known, and there are many velocity models for the region, allowing us to compare their effects on the solutions. First, moment tensor inversion was performed by determining stations with good azimuthal coverage. Then, moment tensor inversions were continued, decreasing the azimuthal coverage from 360° to 90° (per 90°) and to lower than 90°. Reliable and accurate solution conditions evaluated the parameters obtained from the inversions. Strike, dip, and rake angles were compared to the focal mechanism parameters obtained from the catalog. Moreover, moment tensor inversions were performed with single-station 3 component records. As a result, moment tensor inversion (MTI) solutions generally remain stable even when azimuthal coverage is reduced. As long as the coverage remains above approximately 180°, solution reliability is not significantly affected – except for single-station solutions. Although some strike, dip, and rake angles obtained from single-station three-component records appear consistent with catalog values, key reliability parameters such as FMVAR frequently exceed the accepted threshold of 30°. FMVAR frequently exceeds the accepted threshold of 30°, even when the azimuthal angle of the station is above 180° and waveform fits look good. Since single-station solutions often fail to meet reliability thresholds such as FMVAR < 30°, they should only be used cautiously, as the ISOLA software also emphasizes. While the analysis was conducted on light earthquakes, the methodology and findings are highly relevant to smaller events, such as micro-earthquakes, which often face similar challenges, including low signal-to-noise ratios and sparse station distribution. This research highlights the potential for applying these techniques to small- and micro-earthquakes by proving the reliability of moment tensor solutions under constrained conditions."

    "title": "Modelling of amplification of P-SV waves in an elastic medium using finite difference modelling technique",
    "abstract": "Abstract The present study aims to model the amplification in the primary phase of the vertical component generated during the Tohoku earthquake on 11th March 2011 ( M w 9.0). The primary phase of the vertical motion generally consists of P-SV waves. The observed records from the rock site at the borehole and surface of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake clearly show that there is a notable amount of amplification in the P-SV phase of the ground motion when energy reaches the surface of the earth. The amplification occurred in the P-SV wave while energy propagated from the borehole to the surface. Therefore, detailed modelling of shallow subsurface structure in a highly undulating terrain is performed using the finite difference technique. This is one of the methods that completely utilizes the detailed subsurface characteristics and topography for synthetically generating the particle motion at the surface. A comparison of simulated and observed P-SV records at the surface in terms of root mean square error of waveforms, their response spectra, and peak values, which clearly provides a satisfactory answer to the observations regarding the amplification in P-SV waves. Research highlights Strong ground motion data from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is used for the study. Amplification in the P-SV phase of the observed vertical component from borehole to surface is noticed. A finite difference modelling technique is used to model the amplification of P-SV waves. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of observed and simulated P-SV shows the efficacy of finite difference modelling techniques in studying amplification effects in P-SV waves."

    "title": "Geological constraints on the distribution of naturally occurring uranium and thorium in soils of southwestern Spain",
    "abstract": "Naturally occurring uranium (U) and thorium (Th) concentrations in soils of southwestern Spain were explored to assess their spatial variability, establish regional geochemical baselines, and identify anomalies. A total of 505 soil and 95 bedrock samples were collected from distinct geological domains across the Iberian Massif, Betic Cordillera, and Guadalquivir Basin. Total U and Th concentrations (size fraction < 2 mm) were determined by ICP-OES, with median values of 2.30 mg kg −1 for U and 8.80 mg kg −1 for Th in topsoil, slightly exceeding those in subsoil and bedrock. Parent rock lithology was found to be the primary factor controlling U and Th concentrations in soils. The highest contents were observed in Cambisols developed on granitic rocks over the Central Iberian Zone and the Ossa-Morena Zone of the Iberian Massif. Geochemical baselines were established, with upper limits of 18.0 mg kg −1 for Th and 4.7 mg kg −1 for U in topsoil, and 16.1 mg kg −1 for Th and 4.2 mg kg −1 for U in subsoil. Anomalies exceeding these threshold values were mainly observed in samples from monzogranites of the Los Pedroches batholith and tonalites of the Santa Olalla stock. Statistical analysis revealed strong correlations between Th and light rare earth elements, suggesting that Th is primarily hosted by monazite. The variability in U and Th concentrations could have environmental monitoring implications, as elevated levels may influence radiation exposure. Future work should integrate high-resolution mapping, mineralogical analysis, and radiological assessments to refine anomaly detection and evaluate potential risks."

    "abstract": "Land use land cover (LULC) changes are a significant driver of environmental and climate change, which impact ecosystem services and human well-being. This study employs geo-information modelling and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate spatial-temporal changes on LULC and land surface temperature (LST) over the past three decades, focusing on the Mandi Bahauddin (MBD) district of Pakistan. The LULC maps were prepared for the years 1983, 2003, and 2023 by using supervised classification techniques, such as random forest and support vector machine (SVM). Our outcomes showed that the vegetation area decreased by 2.57%, while the built-up area increased by 4.58% from 1983 to 2023 in the MBD region. It was noted that average LST values increased by 0.95°C from 1983 (26.75°C) to 2023 (27.7°C) due to the expansion of built-up areas as well as the reduction of vegetative areas. In the present study, the regression coefficients ( R 2 ) of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.75 were observed in 1983, 2003, and 2023, respectively, between LST and NDVI. According to our study, a positive relationship ( R 2 ) between NDBI and LST was found at 0.77, 0.80, and 0.82, respectively, for 1983, 2003, and 2023. The findings underscore the importance of establishing and sustaining LULC planning and management procedures to mitigate and adapt to climate change, given the link between LULC and LST. Although the LULC results provide valuable insights for the judicious and optimal use of land resources, policy implications for this domain still require further development."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis and machine learning-based prediction of rainfall patterns across six major Indian cities: Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. The research distinguishes statistical analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) – with an explained variance ratio of 86.7% for PCA1 and 13.3% for PCA2 – and seasonal decomposition, revealing trend means ranging from 1.7 mm in Delhi to 4.9 mm in Kolkata, from machine learning-based predictions utilizing models like XGBoost (accuracy: 76.5%), random forest (accuracy: 76.6%), and gradient boosting (accuracy: 76.6%). The selection of these models is guided by their proven efficiency in handling medium-sized structured datasets, although future work may explore deep learning and hybrid approaches to enhance performance. Seasonal differences are highlighted, such as monthly rainfall peaks of 12.1 mm in Chennai (November), 20.2 mm in Kolkata (July), and 18.5 mm in Mumbai (July). The findings underscore practical implications for real-world applications, including early warning systems and climate adaptation strategies. Validation against historical records strengthens the reliability of trends, providing valuable insights for urban planning and disaster management."

    "abstract": "The Lower Bajocian/Upper Bajocian transition was analysed in the Casa Chimeneas section (JRi3), Sierra de Ricote (Murcia), which is located in the Median Subbetic paleogeographic domain. This stratigraphic section, consisting of an alternation of marls and marly limestones with radiolarians, finely shelled bivalves, Zoophycos and frequent ammonites, represents the best stratigraphic sequence of the Subbetic (Betic Range) and, also possibly, of the Mediterranean province (westernmost Tethyan Realm) to carry out this analysis. Ammonite have been sampled since the 90s increasing the collection available, which, together with the analysis of calcareous nannofossil assemblages and the carbon-isotope δ 13 C curve, allows accurately modify the position of the Lower Bajocian/Upper Bajocian boundary in this stratigraphic reference section. Ammonite assemblages are dominated by Oppeliinae, Phylloceratoidea and Sphaeroceratidae, but other taxa with more biostratigraphical value (Stephanoceratinae, Cadomitinae, Frebolditinae, Leptosphinctinae and Parkinsoniidae) are also common. The absence of the typical Teloceras and the scarcity of Caumonstisphinctes make difficult to recognize the base of the Upper Bajocian. The appearance of the species Leptosphinctes constrictus , the last records of the genus Paviceras , and the species Masckeites ? aff. exilis and Subcollina ochoterenai are the most significant bioevents marking this boundary. The first specimens, but not first occurrences, which would be recorded below the oldest studied sample, of the calcareous nannofossils Cyclagelosphaera margerelii and Crepidolithus crassus are identified in the base of the Blagdeni Subzone, and those of Discorhabdus ignotus and Ethmorhabdus gallicus within the upper part of the same subzone. The last occurrences (LOs) of Hexalithus magharensis and Carinolithus superbus are located within the Niortense Zone. Significant fluctuations are recorded in the δ 13 C curve in the Lower Bajocian/Upper Bajocian transition coinciding with the turnover of ammonites and the increase in diversity of calcareous nannofossils. Some ammonite taxa with significant biostratigraphic value are herein described and illustrated for the first time in Sierra de Ricote."

    "title": "A simple and efficient method for palynological sample preparation",
    "abstract": "The extraction of organic microfossils is a process that requires techniques based on the elimination of the mineral components of the rock (mainly silicates and carbonates) and the subsequent concentration of the microfossils. These techniques are very diverse and have in common the dissolution of the rock (maceration) with hydrofluoric acid and concentrated hydrochloric acid to extract the organic matter, which is potentially made up of dispersed organic matter and organic walled microfossils. In this process, there are at least two fundamental objectives. First, that the process respects the fidelity of the organic microfossil record (diversity and preservation). Second, effective elimination of dispersed organic matter, obtaining the maximum concentration of microfossils and microscopic slides with a homogeneous dispersion that allows optimal observing conditions. The method described in this paper is based on a filtration process of the organic matter resulting from the maceration process, employing polyester filters and a vacuum inversion system. In the standard vacuum process, the dispersed organic matter clogs the pores of the filter. The vacuum inversion injects filtered water that unclogs the pores of the filter vessel. The alternation between normal and reverse vacuum results in the progressive elimination of the dispersed organic matter and the concentration of the organic microfossils in a rapid and non-aggressive process."

    "title": "Low-field magnetic fabrics and mineralogy of subvolcanic dykes from northern Portugal: Magma flow and petrogenetic implications",
    "abstract": "The Permo-Carboniferous hypabyssal magmatism is a well-recorded event throughout southwestern Europe, associated with the post-collisional setting that followed the Variscan orogeny. In northern Portugal, this episode is represented by porphyry, lamprophyre, and dolerite dykes, many of which were studied within the scope of this work using methodologies such as isothermal remanent magnetization, frequency-dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, thermomagnetic analyses, and low-field anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. The main goals are to report the respective magnetic mineralogy and fabrics, to provide insights into magma flow directions and emplacement conditions, and to complement our understanding about the petrogenetic evolution of the aforementioned subvolcanic rocks. The AMS fabrics of most leucocratic lithotypes is normal and undisturbed by tectonic deformation. Such observation is compatible with the average low anisotropy degrees ( P para (%) = 0.92–4.28%) implying passive emplacement of the melts. Kfd measurements indicate that superparamagnetic particles are likely to exist in rare cases, inducing low bulk susceptibilities. Furthermore, inverse fabrics are probably associated with deuteric and/or post-magmatic alterations. Considering the results of the rock magnetism tests, magnetite is present in all specimens (felsic, intermediate, and mafic). Magnetite is dominantly primary in the mafic lithologies, but mostly secondary in the felsic dykes, as well as generated from exsolutions from iron-bearing silicates. Nonetheless, the presence of primary magnetite in the porphyries and microgranites cannot be completely discarded due to possible magma mixing, as suggested by the coexistence of mantled and non-mantled feldspars, as well as previous geochemical and isotopic evidence."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive spatial–statistical analysis of landslide occurrences in Kerala, India, focusing on the relationship between landslide frequency, size, and various predisposing factors. The analysis reveals a nonlinear correlation between slope angle and both landslide frequency and size: The highest frequency of events occurs on moderate slopes (20°–35°), whereas larger landslides are associated with steeper slopes (>40°). Although 44% of events occurred in regions receiving <440 mm of rainfall, these areas showed higher probability densities, indicating frequent, smaller landslides. In contrast, lower landslide frequencies but larger events were observed in zones exceeding 440 mm rainfall and at higher elevations. Western and southwestern slope aspects account for the majority of landslides, with probability density peaking on west-facing slopes. Additionally, convex and concave slope curvatures were most susceptible to frequent failures, though curvature exerted minimal influence on landslide size, while terrain ruggedness index (TRI) values between 0.4 and 0.58 are strongly correlated with both frequency and size. Proximity to roads demonstrates an inverse relationship with frequency and size; while most landslides occurred 2001–6000 m from roads, the largest events and highest probability densities were recorded beyond 6000 m. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between topographic, hydrological, and anthropogenic variables in controlling landslide behaviour and offer critical insights for probabilistic landslide susceptibility modelling and hazard mitigation strategies in Kerala."

    "title": "Gondwana platform paleoenvironment reconstruction: insights from the geochemistry of Ordovician black-grey shales in NW Iberia",
    "abstract": "In the northwestern (NW) Iberian Peninsula (NW Gondwana) Ordovician black-grey shales and sandstones were deposited on marine platforms at southern polar latitudes. Provenance, recycling, weathering and redox geochemical proxies were derived from the bulk rock composition of siliciclastic rocks recovered from northwest Spain. Statistically significant proxies were studied across the stratigraphy to interpret the paleoenvironment of this region during the Ordovician period. During the beginning of the Middle Ordovician period, the black-grey shales recorded a noticeable influence of recycling and provenance (Th/Sc, Zr/Sc, Zr/Ti, La/Th), and slightly lower levels of chemical alteration (CIA, Th/U) and oxygen conditions (Ce/Ce*, Y/Ho). Evidence for more felsic and recycled sources and possible periglacial-glacial conditions are consistent with the location of the NW Iberian Peninsula at high latitudes close to the South Pole. Towards the upper part of the Middle Ordovician, the black-grey shales recorded less felsic and less recycled sources, possibly associated with a more temperate climate, more chemical alteration, and a relatively more oxygenated environment. Proposed sedimentary models (glacial-arid conditions becoming more temperate, basinal barriers, and/or upwelling basinal waters shifting to more open ocean and stable conditions) can explain these geochemical variations and support the Ordovician paleoenvironmental reconstructions for this part of Gondwana."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the professional career of Dr Antonio Goy, who has been pointed out as one of the renovators of Geology teaching during the late 20th and early twenty-first centuries, particularly in his role as a Paleontology teacher. Based on the biography of the professor mentioned, this work has been structured to highlight his contributions to science (such as Geology or Paleontology). In this way, Dr Antonio Goy´s biography can contribute to a reflection on the use of Professor biographies for exploring the history of science education and its role as a field of knowledge shared by education didactics and science didactics. He completed his first studies in the high school of Lugo and then studied Geological Sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), where he obtained his PhD in 1974. In 1986, he started as a Professor of Paleontology at Complutense University, where he continued to teach until his retirement in 2011. Despite Dr Antonio Goy's contributions to paleontological research, this paper delves into his facet as a popularizer. Thus, it is noteworthy the numerous lectures he gave and the working groups he led to promote paleontology. Special mention should be made of the social awareness, dissemination and protection work coordinated by Dr Antonio Goy in Fuentelsaz (central Spain) as Aalenian Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP)."

    "title": "High-resolution multi-technique analysis of a continuous sediment core of the Baza Formation at Barranco León (Guadix-Baza Basin, Granada): First petrophysical results",
    "abstract": "We report the first continuous core-based sedimentary record obtained at Barranco León, Spain, based on two boreholes drilled on the western and eastern margins of the ravine. The sediment cores cover an 80 m-thick succession belonging to the Baza Formation, which includes the lithic artefact- and fossil-bearing deposits documenting one of the earliest evidence of hominin presence in western Europe. Based on a series of observations performed at macroscopic (core description) and microscopic (grain size, fabric, thin sections) scales combined with the results obtained from the high-resolution multi-technique analysis of the natural radioactivity, magnetic susceptibility and carbonate content along the sediment cores, we identified six main lithostratigraphic units (named LU1 to LU6 from top to bottom) showing distinct compositions, textures and petrophysical properties. While our results are overall consistent with those from previous works based on outcropping sediment, we nevertheless provide here an unprecedented, detailed and continuous characterization of the 80-m thick sedimentary sequence at Barranco León. In particular, this is the first time that the deposits located > 15 m below the archaeological level can be accessed and thoroughly described in this area. Consequently, the present work offers a robust lithostratigraphic framework for future chronological and paleoenvironmental studies. From a methodological point of view, we observe a good consistency between the various data sets collected, independently of whether they were obtained from in situ or laboratory analyses, or using non-invasive or more destructive approaches. In particular, the magnetic susceptibility records obtained from the direct measurement of the core with a multi-sensor core logger, and from discrete samples collected from that same core, are in excellent agreement."

    "abstract": "This article consists of two well-differentiated parts. The first, based on a bibliographic analysis, tries to position this current episode of global warming within the framework of the geological history of climate change. The conclusion is clear and in line with the scientific consensus. Greenhouse gas emissions linked to human actions are the main cause of global warming. Given this situation, we can speculate about the future climate evolution of the “Anthropocene”. Unfortunately, such projections in the scientific literature paint a bleak picture. Paradoxically, future predictions take us back millions of years in geological history, placing humanity in unknown territory. Accordingly, we must ask ourselves what we can do to adjust the global thermostat. A first optimistic reflection is that the very fact that humans are the cause of the problem opens a window of hope. If global warming were due to natural causes linked to astronomical phenomena, to the internal dynamics of the planet, or to its evolution, we could do little or nothing to remedy our current climate situation. However, if we are the main cause of the crisis, we have the capacity to resolve it. This consideration, in turn, leads us to the second part of this article which comprises a series of personal reflections on the nature of the so-called energy transition and its main lines of action."

    "title": "Extreme climatic events linked to the early Toarcian warming and mass extinction indicated by trace elements distribution in seawater, in North Spain",
    "abstract": "During the Early Jurassic, at least two important climate changes were recorded, the Late Pliensbachian cooling event which was followed by the Early Toarcian superwarming interval. This warming interval conditioned a second-order mass extinction. Some other significant events usually concurred this interval, such as the presence of an oceanic anoxic event (TOAE) and a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE). However, no much research has been carried out concerning the consequences of this warming interval in the atmosphere, such as the evidence of extreme climatic events, linked to the enhancement of the hydrological cycle. For this purpose, 71 trace elements were analyzed on 15 diagenetically screened belemnites from the Rodiles section of North Spain. Several anomalous values were recorded below and above the extinction boundary virtually in all the analyzed elements. Correlation coefficient between the redox sensitive elements (RSEs) as well as many other trace elements respect to aluminium (Al), indicates that these trace elements were mainly derived from terrestrial debris and, consequently, interpretations of the redox conditions from the RSEs are unreliable. The mercury (Hg) anomalies coincide with the anomalies of many other trace elements, suggesting that this element could be derived from terrestrial sources, and probably would not be linked to volcanism, but this possibility cannot be discarded. The increase of nutrient-type elements below the extinction boundary indicates that the substantial decrease or lack of nutrient-type elements cannot be argued to explain this extinction. Selenium (Se) depletion, pointed by previous authors as an important proxy of extinction events, has not been recorded, as Se distribution shows a positive peak value below the extinction boundary, during the extinction interval. Rare earth elements show a very similar trend to the other analyzed elements, a well-marked anomaly immediately below the extinction boundary, and other smaller anomaly located above the extinction boundary, also visible in the Total rare earth elements. Among the calcareous nannofossils, few species experienced size reduction and/or morphological and abundance changes during this time interval. All these events could be linked to accelerate weathering and strong perturbations recorded in the atmosphere in the early stages of the warming processes."

    "abstract": "The lithostratigraphy, age and paleoenvironmental interpretation of Lower to Middle Jurassic carbonates in Sierra Cabrera (Almería) and Cerro de San Antón (Málaga city) add to the knowledge of the sedimentary evolution of the Maláguide Complex (Internal Zones, Betic Cordillera, southern Spain). In the Barranco de Azagador section in Sierra Cabrera, Sinemurian–Pliensbachian shallow-water carbonates show a mosaic breccia and a hardground at the top. The breccia matrix and the overlying deposits are reddish crinoid packstones with hardgrounds and ammonites late Pliensbachian in age. These features suggest an extensional breakup of an initial carbonate platform giving way to pelagic reduced sedimentation. Three overlying intervals of debris-fall breccias evidence deposition on or at the base of an escarpment. Clasts in the last breccia are Middle Jurassic oolites. In the Cerro de San Antón, shallow-water carbonates change upwards to several intervals of debris-fall breccias with clasts from underlying carbonates and a crinoid packstone matrix. Crinoid packstones with hardgrounds and late Pliensbachian-earliest Toarcian ammonites overlie the breccias. As in the Barranco de Azagador, the disintegration of the pre-late Pliensbachian carbonate platform was followed by pelagic sedimentation on or at the foot of an escarpment. The crinoid packstone is brecciated and covered with a red sandstone that also fills the spaces of laterally equivalent breccias, indicating emersion. Marine sedimentation was regained in the Middle Jurassic with ooid grainstones formed in shoals. The sedimentary evolution of both sections reflects the Pliensbachian rifting phase recognised in other areas of the Maláguide Complex, although the later evolution differs in the two study outcrops."

The assemblage contains cosmopolitan and diverse fauna including Hoernesia socialis (Schlotheim), Myophoria vulgaris (Schlotheim), Pleuromya elongata (Schlotheim), Unionites fassaensis (Wissmann), and Neoschizodus laevigatus (Goldfuss). Additionally, the ichnofauna of the site is described and studied for the first time, including the ichnogenera Planolites , Oravaichnium , Taenidium and Thalassinoides . Sedimentary facies record a variety of environments including coastal shabkha, carbonate tidal flats, subtidal agitated areas and shallow mid-ramp settings, that define the installation of a carbonate ramp in the area in response to the first broad marine Triassic transgression. The bivalve fossils were found in facies corresponding to well-oxygenated shallow-marine (mid ramp) environments, characterized by low energy conditions excepting moderate wave action during storms. These environments probably represent for this area the conditions of maximum marine flooding during the first extensive transgressive episode that occurred during the Middle Triassic in Iberia."

    "abstract": "The late Carboniferous—early Permian sedimentary record from the Minas de Henarejos area, located in the SE Iberian Ranges, E Spain, is a key location to study the transition between the Variscan and the Alpine tectonic regimes and the changes between the Carboniferous to Permian flora related to the end of the cold stage of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age in the equatorial zone. The Minas de Henarejos Basin is unique in the Iberian Ranges, as it contains a thick succession of Carboniferous continental sediments rich in macroflora remains and with thick coal beds. The area was subjected to iron and coal mining during different periods of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and at present it offers magnificent outcrops due to the intense coal extraction work carried out at the beginning of the last decade. The present multidisciplinary study has allowed us to define three new informal lithostratigraphic units based on their lower and upper boundaries, lithological, mineralogical, and sedimentary characteristics, the presence of macroflora, and their degree of deformation. The oldest Minas de Henarejos Unit (1), unconformably overlying Variscan basement, is characterized by dark gray lutites, sandstones, conglomerates, and coal beds deposited in low sinuosity fluvial systems that evolved to lacustrine systems. Based on its macroflora content, this unit has been dated as Stephanian B (late Carboniferous). The overlying Narboneta Unit (2), separated by an erosional unconformity, comprises white breccias and conglomerates of proximal alluvial fans and incipient fluvial systems. These are overlain by the red conglomerates of the Fuente del Compadre Unit (3), again separated by an erosional conformity. All three units underwent compressive deformation linked to the late-stage Variscan compressive regime, which is not noted in the overlying middle Permian Boniches Fm., this latter unit deposited after a long hiatus and comprising red conglomerates of fluvial systems related to large alluvial fans and linked to the extensional Alpine phase. A change in the type of paleosols, from the Histosols of wet climates to Entisols of alternating wet and dry periods, is in agreement with the clay mineral compositions, which suggests humid climate conditions during the Carboniferous and early Permian and a change to more arid conditions during Middle Permian times."

    "title": "Unravelling an enigma: a reappraisal of the constructional program of the ichnogenus Lapispira Lange",
    "abstract": "The corkscrew-like ichnogenus Lapispira Lange is characterized as a double, concentric, helicoidal tubular burrow, with its coiling axis almost perpendicular to bedding, produced within a fine-grained unconsolidated sediment. Almost neglected since first described in 1932 from Hettangian beds in Germany, it received renewed attention in recent decades. Here, the previously available evidence is reassessed and supplemented with new data, from Lower Jurassic deposits of the Neuquén Basin in Argentina. As a result, a revised diagnosis is provided, a better understanding of its complex morphology and three-dimensional structure is revealed and two alternative fabricational models are contrasted. In Lange’s model a building mechanism similar to the one of Gyrolithes has been assumed, whereas in Seilacher’s model a process more closely related to the genesis of Rhizocorallium was envisaged. The finding of remarkably well-preserved materials from Pliensbachian outcrops in southern Mendoza province, that show a series of protrusive spreiten between the subparallel limbs of the external and internal coils, supports the second alternative. Consequently, the lack of spreiten in previously known cases, is attributed to an unfavourable nature of the unconsolidated sediment between both limbs when burrows were made, or to a subsequent obliteration of initial spreiten by taphonomic processes (such as activity by minute bioturbators and/or differential compaction associated with dewatering). Finally, after reviewing relevant functional hypotheses, the elaborate burrow pattern of Lapispira is interpreted as a multi-purpose biogenic structure, beneficial for deposit-feeding, temporary dwelling, deterring intruders, facilitating penetration with structural stability, and minimizing risks of crowding and interference with neighbouring organisms."

    "title": "P–T-X evolution of the fluids associated with Sn-Li mineralization from Pedra Alta (Argemela, Portugal)",
    "abstract": "A comprehensive inspection of the accessible exposures at the Pedra Alta (Argemela, Portugal) old mining site shows that the main Sn-Li carriers (such as cassiterite, stannite and amblygonite-montebrasite) are subvertical, ENE-WSW to E-W trending quartz veins. The local preservation of an early group of quartz-phosphate lodes, affected by boudinage and folding, documents the superposition of diachronic mineralizing events. Both sets are systematically cut by a dense array of low dipping planar joints, interpreted as a late feature of strain accommodation during the Variscan D 3 regional phase of deformation (ca. 320–305 Ma). These observations suggest that the key period for the quartz vein network and mineralization formation at Pedra Alta might have occurred after the climax of D 3 , i.e. around 310 Ma. Thicker quartz veins preserve evidence of multiple opening and minor branching, supporting the inference of a relatively long-lasting evolution. This is consistent with the progression of three main stages of mineral growth, which are dominated by amblygonite, quartz-cassiterite I and quartz-cassiterite II ± stannite ± chalcopyrite. The study of fluid inclusions (FIs) in amblygonite, quartz and cassiterite shows that the ore-forming fluids involved in the Pedra-Alta Sn-Li system are aqueous, with low salinity (< 6.0 wt.% NaCl equiv.) and low volatile content (usually < 7 mol%). Fluids displaying a CO 2 -dominant volatile phase are associated with amblygonite and quartz deposition, and fluids in cassiterite show a volatile component varying from CO 2 -dominated to CH 4 -dominated compositions. This FI record conceivably traces the participation of fluids compositionally buffered by the metasedimentary rocks hosting the quartz lodes throughout the ore-forming events, which is consistent with information provided by δ 18 O and δD values obtained for quartz and cassiterite. Deposition of amblygonite and cassiterite has occurred under distinct P–T conditions, clearly higher for the formation of the former mineral phase. Fluid inclusions preserved in the different bands of zoned cassiterite indicate two main crystallization stages for this oxide, the first occurring at ca. 400 °C and 110 MPa from low salinity CO 2 -dominated fluids and the second at lower temperature (ca. 300 °C) from CH 4 -enriched fluids."

    "title": "Largely allochthonous Triassic units in the Central Betics inferred from their contrasting paleogeographic origin (Cambil, Jaén, Spain)",
    "abstract": "Triassic clayey-evaporitic materials played an important role in the detachment of tectonic units when structuring the Betic Cordillera. In the Cambil sector (Jaén, southern Spain), Triassic outcrops of detrital-evaporitic materials and carbonates have been interpreted as a nappe (\"Cambil nappe\"). The great development of breccias with clayey-gypsiferous matrix within these materials may be related to an olistostromic unit of the Oligocene-Aquitanian. However, such a redeposit of Triassic materials in the Subbetic Zone during the Miocene is controversial. The geological mapping carried out in this study reveals the tectonic complexity of the area. Large blocks of different nature and age crop out throughout the sector. The identification of Muschelkalk carbonate units of diverse paleogeographic origin, based on the Triassic stratigraphy, implies structures undergoing displacements of almost one hundred kilometers. Largely brecciated bands would be related, in this context, to tectonic structures of brittle-plastic range developed on clayey-gypsiferous materials. Salt tectonics alone cannot explain these regional displacements; hence most of the described tectonic fabrics must be associated with the thrusting and strike-slip faulting of the Betic fold and thrust belt."

    "title": "Petrogenesis of the alkaline lamprophyre cluster between Molí d’en Ponç and Collet de la Cidereda (eastern Catalonian Coastal Ranges, NE Iberia)",
    "abstract": "This work focuses on the cretaceous camptonite cluster between Molí d’en Ponç and Collet de la Cidereda, eastern Montseny massif from the Catalan Coastal Ranges (NE Iberian Peninsula). These post-orogenic lamprophyres (~ 79 Ma) crosscut Palaeozoic and late Variscan granitoids. Their intrusion is related to the opening of the Bay of Biscay. Thus, they belong to the Late Cretaceous Iberian Alkaline Igneous Province. The studied cluster comprises two sills displaying a N110-N140-trending direction and subvertical dikes that intrude the camptonite sills or the granodioritic host rock. Dy N /Yb N ratios ≥ 2.4 show that the primary melts of the studied camptonites were generated at pressures higher than ~ 2.5 GPa (~ 80 km) on the garnet stability field close to the transition to the spinel stability field. The more evolved melts, corresponding to sodic alkaline basalts, were subjected to within-plate enrichment and fractional crystallization processes. The olivine antecrysts and microlites correspond to forsterite (Fo 74 to Fo 88 ). They do not show peridotitic mantle source composition and some are in equilibrium with sulfides. The clinopyroxene antecrysts correspond to diopside (Mg# 75–80) and do not show peridotitic mantle source composition. The forsterite, diopside, and kaersutite antecrysts display compositional oscillatory variations related to mixing processes associated with ascending successive magma pulses. The higher concentrations of Mn in forsterite and diopside microlites from the groundmass, compared to the antecrysts, are consistent with a more evolved composition of the ascending magma. The pressure estimation obtained from diopside antecryst cores (~ 1 GPa) supports the stagnation of ascending magma in the lower crust or the transitional boundary between the lower crust and upper mantle. The pressure obtained from clinopyroxene antecryst rims is ~ 0.28 GPa."

    "title": "Sandstone provenance and diagenesis as tools for the definition of lithostratigraphic units",
    "abstract": "This study analyzes the provenance and diagenesis of the Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous sandstone deposits of the NW South-Iberian Basin (Teruel and Valencia provinces, SE Spain) in order to understand the controls on their field appearance (color and friability), which conditioned the definition of formal lithostratigraphic units. Specifically, analyzed sandstone belongs to the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian Villar del Arzobispo Fm, a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic unit deposited in coastal, fluvial, deltaic and aeolian sedimentary environments. This unit includes, at its uppermost part, the essentially siliciclastic, very friable and whitish deposits previously assigned to the El Collado Fm, a unit traditionally assigned to the Barremian and recently dated as Kimmeridgian-Tithonian. Compositional provenance study has included point-counting and K-feldspar and tourmaline microprobe analyzes. Sandstones are mainly arkoses, which have similar framework composition all along the studied sedimentary record. The absence of plagioclases in all samples indicates strong chemical weathering in source areas, which is characteristic of warm and wet climatic conditions. The source areas were mostly peraluminic granites, probably from the Central Iberian Zone (Iberian Massif), located more than 200 km away to the NW of the study area; Paleozoic metaquartzites, slates and schists from the Iberian Massif plus sedimentary rocks from nearby areas. The lower and middle-upper parts of the Villar del Arzobispo Fm have sedimentary carbonate rock fragments, which influenced pervasive carbonate precipitation during diagenesis, generating their competent field appearance. However, the uppermost part of this formation, traditionally assigned to the El Collado Fm, has very low carbonate rock fragments and large amount of kaolinite epimatrixes, which favored its whitish and friable appearance. Thus, the color and friability of the sandstone deposits were mainly controlled by diagenetic processes and not by changes in source areas, advising the consideration of diagenetic processes when defining sandstone stratigraphic units."

    "abstract": "The lower Toarcian ammonites of the upper Uanei Formation from SW Somalia are revised following their taphonomic analysis. Two fossiliferous layers are distinguished: a lower one, characterized by assemblage of hildoceratid taxa of the subfamilies Hildoceratinae and Bouleiceratinae, is dated to the transition Tenuicostatum to Serpentinum zones; the upper layer is aged to the transition from the Serpentinum to Bifrons zones, based on the mixing of Parahildaites pl. sp. and Harpoceratinae without Bouleiceratinae. Taxonomic details of the genus Bouleiceras are discussed and represented by six species, two of which are new: B. lanceolatum n. sp. and B. goyi n. sp. The potential of further research in the eastern margin of the African plate is discussed with the perspective of reinforcing its role as a centre of dispersion for the Bouleiceratinae towards the western Tethys and the Andean basins in the Serpentinum Zone."

    "title": "Some facts on the evolution of rugose corals during the Mississippian",
    "abstract": "The Mississippian is an epoch that represents the transition from Devonian greenhouse conditions to Permo-Carboniferous icehouse modes. During that time, the marine faunas experienced a recovery after the late Devonian mass extinctions. This article presents the evolution of the rugose corals during the Mississippian in the western Palaeotethys province, as an example of the general evolution of rugose corals in that epoch. A database based on more than 700 papers and the revision of several collections along Europe has been built with the recorded genera, detailing the areas and times where and when they appear. Although we have a database with the vast majority of the species described or mentioned in the Mississippian of the western Palaeotethys, we have chosen to make the comparison at the genus level. This is based on the very large number of species in open nomenclature (sp., cf., aff.,?, etc.) and the many synonyms that are difficult to verify. With this database, analyses of the appearance/extinction of the genera and the distribution by types of habits have been carried on. These analyses have been compared with environmental data taken from the literature. In addition, evolutionary schemes have been built for some selected families (the Zaphrentidae, the Palaeosmilidae, the Lonsdaleiidae and the Lithostrotionidae) paying special attention to the main trends in the evolution of the rugose corals. In most cases, these evolutionary schemes are based in previous studies, plus the data provided in our research."

    "title": "Taphonomy and biostratigraphy of the Upper Pliensbachian to Lower Toarcian foraminifera from the western sector of the Basque-Cantabrian Basin (Spain)",
    "abstract": "This work represents the most complete approximation to date of the taphonomy, biostratigraphy and bioevents recorded in the foraminifera of the Upper Pliensbachian-Middle Toarcian in the western sector of the Basque-Cantabrian Basin (Spain). The foraminifera are preserved as skeletal remains or internal moulds, consistent with resedimented elements with minimal transport, autochthonous or para-autochthonous. The assemblages are typical of the Atlantic Boreal Domain and inhabited a marine platform of normal salinity. The Lagenina Suborder is the most abundant and diverse, and the Miliolina, Robertinina, Spirillinina and Textulariina suborders are accessory in most of the samples. A foraminiferal biozonation calibrated against the standard ammonite biozonation is proposed. The Upper Pliensbachian to Middle Toarcian interval is divided into two biozones (Prima and Chicheryi) and five subzones (Sublaevis, Obonensis, Aragonensis, Clathrata and Iberica). The biotic crisis recorded globally in the Tenuicostatum Chronozone has also been detected in this basin. This crisis produced the stepwise extinction of typical Lower Jurassic species but without affecting generic and supra-generic taxonomic categories. Several Pliensbachian-Toarcian transition and Lower Toarcian characteristic species, such as Eoguttulina palomerensis , Planularia obonensis and Saracenella aragonensis , previously identified in different Spanish and European basins, have also been recorded in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin. After the extinction, a bioevent of diversification takes place in the Serpentinum Chronozone with the appearance of the genus Citharina and other characteristic taxa of the Toarcian and Middle Jurassic. The composition of the assemblages and the recorded bioevents are comparable to those of other areas in the Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Europe."

    "title": "Magnetic properties of iron ores from two Ordovician deposits in Northern Portugal: Marão and Moncorvo",
    "abstract": "The Vila Cova do Marão Mining Field (VCMF) and the Moncorvo Iron Complex (MIC) in northern Portugal are important geo-resources of iron. Here we provide a detailed characterisation of their mineralogy through petrographic observations and magnetic properties. Petrographic observations show the VCMF ore primarily consists of quartz, magnetite, and chlorite, while the MIC ore of hematite and quartz, with rare magnetite occurrences. The magnetic susceptibility (χ) of the VCMF host rock is ~ 2470 × 10 ⁻8 m 3 /kg, while the VCMF ore deposits have χ of ~ 20,500 × 10 ⁻8 m 3 /kg. MIC ores show lower χ values of 520–700 × 10 ⁻8 m 3 /kg. Isothermal Remanent Magnetisation (IRM) component unmixing of the VCMF host rock indicates that the magnetic population is represented by a single component with B 1/2 of 45–55 mT and DP values 0.30–0.35 mT, respectively, typical of magnetite. The VCMF ore is characterised by a single component with B 1/2 of 32–44 mT and DP of 0.30–0.35, typical of magnetite. The MIC ore shows two components: component 1 with B 1/2 of 50 mT and DP values of 0.31–0.37 mT, typical of magnetite, and component 2 with B 1/2 of 500 mT and DP of 0.19–0.26, typical of hematite. IRM at saturation (SIRM) of component 1 is 116–248 A/m for the host rock, 1100–2400 A/m for the VCMF samples, and 209–335 A/m for the MIC samples, providing an approximation of magnetite concentration. The Cisowski test shows the presence of strongly interacting single-domain particles (0.16 < R < 0.24) in all samples. Our data provides useful information for future iron ore resource exploration in the area."

    "abstract": "An exceptional specimen of Rehmannia ( Loczyceras ) is described in this work. Its body chamber includes two paired aptychi that according to its morphological characteristics correspond to Praetriaptychus (typical of Perisphinctidae). The ammonoid comes from the municipality of Quintanas de Hormiguera (Palencia, Spain), and although its precise stratigraphic position is unknown, considering the taxonomic identification it is most likely that it corresponds to Callovian materials. The presence of aptychi inside the body chamber in approximately original anatomical position with this type of taphonomic conservation is rare in the fossil record. On the other hand, the type of function that these anatomical pieces had is a highly discussed topic in the literature that arouses significant interest. From educational or dissemination approaches, it can also be considered a highly interesting example since it allows to communicate the anatomical characteristics of these extinct organisms to society. These types of palaeontological elements and their great value in actions related to Geodiversity can be utilized as formal or non-formal ex situ educational tools."

    "abstract": "Este estudio se ha realizado para evaluar el origen de las rocas carbonatadas del Eoceno Inferior- Oligoceno Superior de la formación Gaziantep en las proximidades de Egil-Diyarbakir, ubicada en Anatolia Oriental, Turquía. Para lograrlo, se investigaron las propiedades estratigráficas y petrográficas, así como las composiciones químicas e isotópicas de las 56 muestras representativas de rocas carbonatadas tomadas de cuatro secciones estratigráficas medidas dentro de la formación Gaziantep. Según los datos obtenidos, la mayoría de las rocas carbonatadas examinadas se han clasificado como dolomita (D), dolomita calcítica (CD), caliza dolomítica (DL) y caliza (L). Las muestras tienen valores de Ce que van de 0,23 a 1,55, con un promedio de 0,80, lo que indica un entorno de formación óxica. Los valores de Eu varían de 0,00 a 1,89, con un promedio de 0,97. Los valores de Ce de las muestras presentan una anomalía negativa, mientras que los valores de Eu muestran una anomalía parcialmente positiva. Por lo tanto, los valores de REE de las rocas carbonatadas sugieren que la contaminación terrestre es inexistente o insignificante. Los valores de δ18O para las calizas investigadas varían entre -7,83‰ y -5,33‰ PDB, mientras que los valores de δ13C varían entre -0,17‰ y ‰ -6,90‰ PDB. Las dolomías, por otro lado, tienen valores de δ18O que varían entre -7,74‰ y -1,23‰ PDB y valores de δ13C que varían entre -6,79‰ y -0,68‰ PDB. Además, la temperatura de formación de las dolomías varía entre 39oC y 86oC. Los datos obtenidos, incluyendo la temperatura y las composiciones de δ18O y δ13C, mostraron evidencia significativa de que la dolomita se formó en la Formación Gaziantep en dos etapas distintas. La primera etapa implicó la formación de dolomita (D) en la zona de mezcla a bajas temperaturas durante la etapa diagenética temprana. La segunda etapa implicó la formación de dolomita (CD y DL) en aguas meteóricas y temperaturas en aumento durante la etapa diagenética tardía."

    "title": "Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility as the key to understand the ascending and emplacement mechanisms of granitic plutons: a review",
    "abstract": "The present study includes a multidisciplinary approach applied to seven ilmenite-type granite intrusions outcropping in Northern and Central Portugal, inside the so-called Galícia-Trás-os-Montes (GTMZ) and Central Iberian (CIZ) geotectonic zones. The main goals are to understand the ascent, emplacement mechanisms and deformation patterns evolution during the late stages of Variscan orogeny. To this end, different granites were studied, which currently exemplify distinct levels of the intrusion suites, as they intrude metasedimentary rocks of low metamorphic grade (namely, Freixo de Numão granite (FNG)), or the contact of metasedimentary-granites rocks (such as, Capinha granite (CaG) and Valpaços granite (ValG)), or other granites ( e.g ., Caria-Vila da Ponte pluton (CVPP) and Esmolfe-Matança pluton (EMP)). Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), microstructural and bulk magnetic susceptibility ( K m ) studies were performed. The correlation between AMS and microstructures pointed out that the studied granites exhibit magnetic fabric that mimics the magmatic fabric inherited during a passive ascent and emplacement under an extensional regime. On the other hand, ValG magnetic fabric resulted from the combination of magmatic and tectonic fabrics, being the last one less expressive. AMS data allowed to infer the trajectories drawn by the magnetic foliations providing important clues about the granite intrusions shape. Therefore, distinct 3D shapes were suggested: bell-shape intrusion for CVPP; tongue-shape intrusion for CaG; asymmetric laccolith for EMG and FNG; and, inverted flat drop-shape intrusion for ValG. The fieldwork relationships between the granite intrusions, host rocks and local/regional structures together with AMS results allowed to verify that the ascent and emplacement of studied intrusions were structural controlled using structures like shear zones (ValG, EMG and FNG) and deep strike-slip faults (CaG and CVPP)."

    "title": "Early Middle Jurassic magnetostratigraphy from Iberian sections",
    "abstract": "New magnetostratigraphic data are presented from four well-dated Iberian sections (Fuentelsaz, Cerro Méndez, Sierra de Lúgar and Puerto Escaño, from the Iberian Ranges and the Betic Cordillera) covering the Toarcian–Aalenian and Bajocian–Bathonian boundaries. In addition to a viscous component with the direction of the present-day field, two magnetisation components could be isolated by thermal demagnetisation: a secondary component of always normal polarity and intermediate unblocking temperature (350°–475 °C) and a high unblocking temperature component (up to 575 °C) that exhibited normal and reversed polarities that is considered the characteristic remanent magnetisation of primary origin. The magnetostratigraphic pattern for the Toarcian–Aalenian boundary investigated at Fuentelsaz section (currently the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point for this boundary) correlates well with the obtained from Cerro Méndez 1 section (Betic Cordillera). The transition between both stages took place during a normal magnetozone preceded by a reverse magnetozone located at Lower Aalensis–Upper Meneghinii Zones (the end of the Toarcian). The Bajocian-Bathonian stages are characterized by a high frequency of reversals. For the boundary 3 pairs of magnetozones have been identified from Puerto Escaño and Sierra de Lúgar sections (Betic Cordillera). The end of Bajocian (Upper Parkinsoni Zone) is clearly related to a magnetozone of reversed polarity that precedes the normal magnetozone where the boundary is located. Within the Lower Bathonian Zigzag Zone at least two additional magnetozones have been identified in this work. A critical review of magnetostratigraphic data from Iberian sections allow to propose a composite geomagnetic polarity time scale for the Lower-Middle Jurassic based on Iberian sections."

    "title": "The offshore Alicante Basin: late Neogene basin development at the Internal–External Zone Boundary of the eastern Betics, SE Spain",
    "abstract": "The offshore Alicante Basin is a late Neogene post-orogenic basin located at the northeastern end of the Eastern Betic Shear Zone (EBSZ) of southeastern Spain. Based on the integration of legacy 2D seismic data, well data and outcrop geology, this paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of its stratigraphy, structural geometry and tectonic evolution. The basin was formed as an extensional basin in latest Serravallian-early Tortonian time (ca. 11.5 Ma), accumulating 1500–2000 m of marine sediments of Tortonian-Recent age. The basin overlies the tectonic boundary between the low-grade metamorphic Alpujarride units of the Internal Zone, and the non-metamorphic Mesozoic to Middle Miocene sedimentary rocks of the External Zone of the Betic Cordilleras. This Internal–External Zone Boundary is formed by a north-dipping backthrust that was reactivated in Tortonian time as an extensional basin bounding fault. Active extensional faulting ceased at around 8 Ma, followed by a phase of compression that resulted in basin inversion and basin margin uplift in Late Pliocene–Pleistocene time. Strike-slip tectonics related to the Crevillente Fault and the EBSZ appear to have played a minor role in the structuration of the basin, but may have shaped the structure of the Tabarca Ridge at the southern margin of the basin. The basin appears to form a boundary zone separating predominantly strike–slip faulting to the south and southwest from predominantly normal faulting to the north, accommodating recent compression at the northern end of the EBSZ."

    "title": "Deciphering deformation and magmatism along Finisterra Terrane: AMS petrofabric and geochemistry of sodium-rich orthogneisses of the “Foz do Douro Metamorphic Complex”",
    "abstract": "The “Foz do Douro Metamorphic Complex” (FDMC; “Finisterra Terrane”) represents a mid-crustal section affected by intense deformation related to the Porto-Tomar-Ferreira do Alentejo shear zone. Magnetic fabrics of deformed biotite orthogneisses (BG) and garnet leucocratic orthogneisses (GG) of the newly defined sodium-rich series of the FDMC have been studied using the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) technique. AMS and geochemical signatures of these orthogneisses allowed to infer the nature of the magmatic rocks from which they derived and revealed a change in the fugacity conditions of the granitoid magmas. BG derived from “magnetite-type” granitoids, generated from magmas having a contribution of materials formed at greater depth (upper mantle/lower crust), under oxidizing conditions. On the other hand, the protolith of the GG was generated at lower depths than the protolith of the BG, under reducing conditions. AMS data demonstrates the control of the magnetic anisotropy by strain on both lithologies. AMS results combined with structural data suggest that the magnetic foliation is parallel to the XY-plane of the finite strain ellipsoid of each orthogneiss. The parallelism of the magnetic and tectonic foliations and lineations and the variability of the lineations suggest that the sodium-rich orthogneisses were subject to strain controlled by transpressional structures compatible with the presence of a regional dextral NNE-SSW shear zone."

    "title": "Multicostate terebratulides (Brachiopoda, Early Jurassic) from the South and Eastern peri-Iberian paleomargins: paleobiogeographical and biostratigraphical perspectives in the westernmost Tethys Ocean",
    "abstract": "Lower Jurassic multicostate Terebratulida are substantiated in the Subbetic Domain and reported in the Iberian Range for the first time. Records of this clade are revised in the peri-Iberian platforms (Subbetic, Iberian Range, Gibraltar, North and NE Spain, Lusitanian basin) in order to evaluate their global pattern distribution across the Tethys Ocean. After a new tectonosedimentary analysis, marine swells are proposed as depositional scenarios for the assemblages containing Hesperithyris aff. sinuosa in the southernmost Subbetic paleomargin, sheding light to the intrincate paleogeography of this part from the Betic Range. In the Iberian Range, the same species and Merophricus ? fimbrioides occurred in extensive flooding intervals arriving from the deepest marine populations. As results of taxonomic and paleobiogeographical analyses, two morphotypes, Merophricus - and Hesperithyris -type, are discriminated forming part of the westernmost Tethys migration route. It can be ascertained that their E-W Tethyan spreading was fulfilled for the Merophricus -type from the intra-Mediterranean basins to the westernmost arc of the Tethys Ocean, via the Betic–Gibraltar seaway, reaching the proto-Atlantic northwards (Lusitanian basin) and possibly the northern margin of the Iberian Massif and Western France. In contrast, Hesperithyris aff. sinuosa from the Iberian and Betic ranges correspond to the intra- and peri-Mediterranean Hesperithyris- type, with a different dispersal pattern. The only Lower Jurassic Hesperithyrys -type multicostate terebratulides reported in the boundaries of the NW-Boreal bioprovince derive from the Northeastern Iberian paleomargins, probably due to sporadic incursion events at transgressive episodes. The row of Subbetic epioceanic seamount stepping stones helped the Merophricus -type migration in the E-W Mediterranean route and their pivotal position facilitated the dispersal of both morphotypes via the epicontinental Iberian seaway. In the Subbetic, the Hesperithyris -bearing assemblages are recorded in the Pliensbachian Lavinianum Zone (Portisi and Cornacaldense subzones) equivalent to the basal part of the Margaritatus Zone (Stokesi Subzone) from the Iberian Range where the same species is now recorded, thus correlating the Southern epioceanic paleomargins with the Eastern epicontinental platforms. The origin and dispersal of the Merophricus -type around the Si–Pl boundary concurred with the Western Tethys early pre-rifting stage, and the pre-Domerian drowning of Tethyan platforms is synchronically consistent with the origin and spreading of the Hesperithyris -type."

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to synthesize all the data obtained over the last four decades by the various researchers who have formed part of the multidisciplinary Jurassic research group founded by Professor Antonio Goy. This is, therefore, a review that seeks to integrate data from various studies on different fossil groups in the Iberian Peninsula during the transition from the Early to the Middle Jurassic. The boundary between the Early Jurassic and Middle Jurassic in the Iberian Peninsula is represented by alternating calcareous and marly levels containing abundant fossils of benthic, planktonic, and palynomorphic organisms. Among all of these, the ammonoids offer the best high-resolution biostratigraphy. A detailed review of the ammonoids zonal scales established in the Iberian Peninsula (Iberian Cordillera, Betic Cordillera, Basque-Cantabrian Basin and Lusitanian Basin) has been carried out. Besides, the ammonoid scales defined in the different areas of the Iberian Peninsula have been compared with the standard zonation for northwestern Europe and with the Mediterranean zonation based on the hammatoceratid group, defined in the Betic Cordillera. All these ammonoid scales have been calibrated with established regional scales using brachiopods, foraminifera, ostracods, palynomorphs, and biofacies samples to highlight which species are useful for establishing correlations within the Iberian Cordillera and with other basins in the western Thetys."

    "abstract": "The Peñón the Bernal section in the Sierra de Gádor comprises a succession of limestones, marly limestones and marls in the upper part of the Gádor unit, which belongs to the Alpujárride Complex in the Internal Zones of the Betic Cordillera. Several shell beds in this section and the locality of La Zarba in the same unit include relatively well-preserved macroinvertebrate assemblages. These beds reflect shell concentrations caused by storms and later colonised by epifaunal communities of cemented, epibyssate and endobyssate bivalves. Sedimentary features, fossil traces, and composition of bivalve assemblages indicate that the succession accumulated in a peritidal environment in a restricted carbonate platform with cyclic changes in water depth. The identified bivalve and ammonoid taxa suggest a Ladinian (Middle Triassic) age for the limestones, marly limestones and marls culminating the Gádor unit, so far considered as Upper Triassic in age. Like in other domains in the Betic Cordillera, the macroinvertebrate fauna has strong affinities with the Sephardic bioprovince."

    "title": "New palynostratigraphic data from the Kungurian (Cisuralian) Guncina Formation, Athesian District (Southern Alps, northern Italy) with regional-global correlation",
    "abstract": "At the end of the Cisuralian (early Permian), the Kungurian represents a key phase in plant evolution and in the development of associated pollen and spores. During the Artinskian, a noticeable shift began, with vegetation and palynofloras transitioning from those typical of humid conditions to those better adapted to arid environments, a trend that persisted through the Kungurian. Despite its importance, biostratigraphic studies of Euramerican palynofloras from this time are scarce. This study addresses the gap by examining the palynological content of the Guncina Formation in the eastern Southern Alps, which yields an exceptionally well-preserved microflora. Detailed analysis of these microfossils sheds new light on the composition and diversity of Cisuralian palynofloras and extends to the Kungurian in the Euramerica phytoprovince, the stratigraphic range of the bisaccate pollen Lueckisporites virkkiae and Falcisporites stabilis . These findings refine the biostratigraphic framework of the Cisuralian, enhancing our understanding of the Permian palynological record in the Euramerican phytoprovince."

    "abstract": "The Toro and Tastil Quebradas (river valleys) present different terrace-like geoforms made up of deposits of coarse-grained clastic materials. These terraces display convex-upward surfaces, a highly variable distribution, have a small lateral extension and depend on the lithology of the geological basement, which differs significantly along the quebradas . The number of terraces between one area and another indicates that these terraced geoforms should not be ascribed to one single cause, but rather to a variety of factors, i.e. local variations at base-level. The coarse-grained materials of the terraces are usually arranged in roughly horizontal layers that characterize the outcrops. These are interfingered with fine-grained mud-rich materials. The freshwater gastropod remains in the mud-rich materials indicate that they accumulated in lacustrine-like sedimentary environments. These developed from alluvial fans that spread out from the lateral quebradas to occupy the entire main valley (q uebrada) , giving rise to natural dams and temporary lakes upstream. Absolute data obtained by radiocarbon ( 14 C) methods strongly suggest that the alluvial fans were coeval with the temporary lakes in the Upper Pleistocene - Middle Holocene. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects could have brought about the local variations in base-level that generated the younger temporary lakes, whereas the older ones were probably controlled by precession cycles (at about 21,000 y). The large number of temporary lakes scattered across the region suggests the overlapping of forcing factors at local and regional scales."

    "abstract": "The palynology of the Triassic–Jurassic boundary has been studied in the central sector of the Iberian Range (central Spain). Twenty-two productive samples from five sections contained well-preserved palynological assemblages including 72 taxa. Sediments were collected in different lithostratigraphic units, spanning the Late Carnian to the Early Jurassic. Most levels with Keuper facies were Carnian in age and their assemblages were integrated by diverse operculate, monosaccate and bisaccate gymnosperm pollen. It is inferred that the source vegetation that colonized central Iberia was similar to the one characterizing western Tethys during the late Middle to early Late Triassic. By contrast, all the studied levels from the upper Norian, uppermost Keuper, to the Lower Jurassic facies were dominated by Classopollis (80–100%). It is inferred that the structure of vegetation changed from a diversified conifers/seed ferns forests to a more homogeneous, lower diversity, cheirolepid-dominated, woodland during the late Norian. By the Rhaetian, the vegetation had acquired a structure which remained relatively stable for more than 15 million years until the Pliensbachian. It is then suggested that the events that characterized biotic changes of the Triassic/Jurassic boundary did not affect the vegetation of Central Iberia in any significant way."

This work focuses its NE part that represents the SW marging of the Triassic Ebro Basin. Twenty-one field sections where Permian and Triassic sediments are well exposed were studied. The Permian–Triassic Ebro Basin was a rift structure with a Basin Boundary Fault dipping to the NE, subdivided by strike-slip faults at high angles in three main domains, associated to a domino set of antithetic faults that were reactivated as thrusts during the Alpine compressional stages. Permian sediments are of alluvial fan and ephemeral river nature, while the Triassic sediments are of eolian origin at the base, in the SE domain, and of anabranching river and eolian origin at the top. A correlation scheme of the different Aragonian Branch domains is presented, as well as a proposal of correlation with the Central and SE domains of the Iberian Branch."

From rocks of the Lower Tithonian, with particular reference to the Hybonotum s.s. Subzone, of the Upper Bugarone Formation in Mount Lacerone (Rieti, Sabine Apennines, Italy), the new species Hybopeltoceras olorizi is described here on the basis of a giant macroconch. The specimen is well preserved, that allows to add new data to the original Olóriz diagnosis of the genus and shows a unique morphology making the ammonite very easy to recognise. The new species shows a set of clearly recognisable phenotypical aspects strongly affected by the “Platform Effect” ( sensu Olóriz). The study of calcareous nannoplankton confirm the biostratigraphic attribution."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the detailed analyses of magnetic fabrics, accompanied by stable isotopic composition and microscopic observations, in centimetric and metric scale authigenic carbonate concretions embedded in the Eocene flysch deposits of the Southwestern Pyrenees. Sampling was focused in the carbonate concretions, (in both metric and centimetric scale), in the marls lateral and nearby to the concretions and in the marls located several meters away from the concretions. The inverse magnetic fabrics (k max axes cluster perpendicular to bedding plane) detected in these concretions constitute a fast methodology to uncover the presence of iron-carbonate minerals and the paleoenvironmental significance of their authigenic origin. The subfabric analyses indicate that magnetite is present in all four types of samples with normal magnetic fabric (k min axes perpendicular to bedding). Paramagnetic fabric (low temperature anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility when magnetic susceptibility increases ~ 3.8 times the one at room temperature) overlaps the room temperature magnetic fabric. The microscope observations reveal that iron-enriched dolomite is the main carrier of the inverse fabric in the carbonate concretions at room temperature. The stable isotopic composition indicates minor differences between the Eocene marls and the carbonate concretions and, when compared with previous data, they suggest a marine pore water origin due to bacterial activity during burial. We relate the early diagenetic growth of the concretions to an enhancement in bacterial activity driven by the increased terrigenous and terrestrial organic matter supply during the Middle Eocene Climate Optimum (MECO), a period of global warming."

    "title": "Geochemical evolution and elemental behaviour of playa sediments: impacts of natural weathering and agricultural practices",
    "abstract": "Playas are predominantly alkaline wetlands common in arid and semi-arid regions. These unique ecosystems are heavily influenced by climatic and hydrological processes, such as high evapotranspiration rates and negative water balance. Numerous studies have documented the ecological degradation of these saline ecosystems due to both anthropogenic and natural processes. The present research analyses the mineralogical and elemental changes in six representative playas at different degradation stages in the western External Betics. Chemical weathering and element fractionation were examined to identify the key geochemical factors involved in the degradation of these playa wetlands. A novel methodology for calculating the Fractionation Index (FI) has been developed and applied alongside established geochemical indices, such as the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW), and Vogt’s Residual Index (VRI), as well as analyses of elemental distribution. This approach allows for a comprehensive differentiation of the geochemical processes occurring in nonsaline-alkali, saline-alkali, and degraded playas. The study highlights the role of alkalinity in promoting clay mineral formation, with Na + and Ca 2+ dominating the cationic composition. These findings provide insights into the dynamics of playa ecosystems and inform conservation strategies for managing these vulnerable environments."

    "title": "Primary phosphate mineralization in mandibular elements of middle paleozoic archaeostracans from Spain",
    "abstract": "Archaeostracans are an early fossil crustacean group linked to malacostracans. The earliest archaeostracans are late Cambrian, but the group diversified mostly in the Silurian and Devonian. Complete specimens are known from konservat-lagerstätten, but loose mandibular elements are relatively abundant in decalcified, acid resistant residues of middle Palaeozoic carbonates. These mandibular elements have been assumed to be originally heavily sclerotized and secondarily phosphatized, but have received little attention in the scientific literature. In the present study, we describe isolated mandibular elements, gnathal lobes (likely belonging to a single archaeostracan species), from the middle Palaeozoic of the Cordoba Province, Spain, and provide evidence that they were originally mineralized with calcium phosphate. Our results are in accordance with recent evidence that malacostracans use calcium phosphate to strengthen mechanically challenged areas of their cuticle, particularly the wear prone mandibular surfaces, and support the hypothesis of a dual calcium phosphate/carbonate mineralization system evolving early in arthropods."

    "abstract": "The Early Cretaceous Camarillas Formation represents a thick and extensive estuarine and barrier island-lagoonal depositional system that developed in the Western Tethys (Iberian Basin, eastern Spain). Thirty-seven percent (7 out of 19) of the palynological samples collected from three stratigraphic sections of this formation (six from the sedimentary stage 2 and one from the stage 3) were productive, containing well-preserved palynological assemblages, including 105 taxa. Despite having similar facies to the productive ones, the remaining 63% of the samples were barren of palynomorphs, suggesting that environmental conditions, rather than taphonomical bias, played a key role in preservation. In general, gymnosperm pollen grains and fern spores dominate the palynoflora. Scarce angiosperm pollen grains and aquatic palynomorphs also occur. The most representative taxon in the studied levels is Classopollis obidosensis . Angiosperm pollen predominates in the uppermost productive level, whereas the Cyathidites / Deltoidospora spore-type abounds in a basal one . The palynological study confirms a Barremian age for the Camarillas Formation and provides insights into vegetation mosaics that included conifer-forests along the western Tethyan coasts. However, the data suggest a palaeofloristic change throughout the succession. Firstly (Stage 2), it is characterized by the alternation between xerophytic conifer-woodlands that developed in arid and/or coastal areas and freshwater swamps containing taxodioids and ferns. Then (Stage 3), gymnosperm-producers of the pollen type Cycadopites / Monosulcites and pioneer angiosperms inhabited brackish swamps."

    "abstract": "This study examines 535 ammonite specimens from the main reference sections of Asturian, Basque-Cantabrian, and Lusitanian basins (NW Iberia) that characterise the Raricostatum and Macdonnelli subzones of the Raricostatum Zone (Sinemurian, Lower Jurassic). The fauna is dominated by the family Echioceratidae (89.9%), particularly Echioceras quenstedti , Echioceras raricostatoides and Echioceras raricostatum in the lower Raricostatum Subzone, and Paltechioceras boehmi , Paltechioceras favrei , Paltechioceras rothpletzi , and Paltechioceras bavaricum in the upper part. The Macdonnelli Subzone is characterised by Leptechioceras meigeni , and Leptechioceras macdonnelli , with the record of Paltechioceras charpentieri , as well as Leptechioceras ( Neomicroceras ) commune , Leptechioceras ( Neomicroceras ) aff. commune , and Leptechioceras ( Neomicroceras ) sparsicosta in northern Spain. These taxonomical identifications enabled a precise biochronostratigraphic framework and strong correlation with the northwestern European Province. The presence of Paltechioceras species shared with both the Mediterranean Province and the Pacific region suggests the possibility of sporadic connections, potentially facilitated by the Hispanic Corridor. The restricted palaeobiogeographic distribution of Echioceras and Leptechioceras , compared to the broad distribution of Paltechioceras , can derive from significant palaeobiology and phenotypic diversity. The identification of Leptechioceras ( Neomicroceras ) in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin slightly expands the previously described distribution of this subgenus. These findings underscore the role of ammonite species in refining biochronostratigraphic divisions and highlight the influence of palaeoenvironmental or palaeobiological factors on the evolution and distribution of Echioceratidae."

    "abstract": "This study examines major outcrops comprising the stratigraphic record of the middle Muschelkalk facies in the Valencian sector of the Triassic Iberian Basin. These outcrops remain poorly understood due to tectonic disruption or diapirism. A palynological assemblage found in the middle Muschelkalk facies of Chelva area corresponds to the Anisian-Ladinian transition, and an assemblage found in lower Keuper facies unit in the same outcrop is here dated as the base of the Julian (early Carnian). Isotope analysis of gypsum (δ 34 S, δ 18 O) from the two facies in the whole study area yields values consistent with those obtained in other Triassic basins of Eastern Iberia. In the present work, the two lithologic lateral domains of the middle Muschelkalk in the Valencian sector, “clayey-evaporite” and “marly-carbonate”, are considered to represent a sharp lateral facies change controlled by coeval faulting. The first domain, in the sector’s western-central part of Valencia area, is made up of a middle red-to-variegated claystone unit separating two gray-to-yellowish units formed by respective clay-gypsum alternations. This domain corresponds to an inner subsident evaporitic mudflat formed by a mosaic of mostly sulfate salinas and some sulfate lagoons. The marly-carbonate domain in the easternmost part of the Valencian sector (Calderona and Espadà ridges) is characterized by a lithologic complex (claystones, marls, carbonates, fine-grained siliciclastics and carbonate breccias) in which precise stratigraphic units are difficult to define, likely reflecting variations induced by differential subsidence or synsedimentary tectonic activity. This domain represents a less subsident shallower setting appearing closer to the basin edge. The two domains belong to the Mediterranean type of Triassic defined in Eastern Iberia. We here make a comparison between the middle Muschelkalk succession of the clayey-evaporite domain and that known in the Triassic Catalan Basin."

    "abstract": "The sedimentary basin that overlies the deformed Variscan basement of the Moroccan Meseta has longtime been attributed to Pennsylvanian–Permian periods, largely based on lithological comparisons. We present a combined sedimentological and palaeontological study introducing a new palaeofloral assemblage from the Senhaja Basin in the Western Jebilet massif of Morocco. As a result, we refine the biostratigraphic age as most likely middle to upper Stephanian. Sedimentological data indicate that the floristic assemblage was fossilized in fine-grained sediments deposited in a lacustrine palaeoenvironment. The macroflora of the Senhaja Basin provides woods, branches, pith casts, leaves and seeds preserved as compressions and impressions in siltstone and claystone. The fossil assemblage consists mainly of tree ferns dominated by the fossil-genus Pecopteris , various Sphenopsids represented by arborescent forms such as Calamites axes, Asterophyllites and Annularia leaves and the herbaceous form Sphenophyllum . Cordaitaleans are represented by their Cordaites -type leaves and Cardiocarpus -type reproductive organs. Conifer leafy twigs were identified as Walchia . The taphonomic and sedimentological analyses allows recognition of two different taphofacies. Among them (1) lake deposits characterized by autochthonous and allochthonous elements in varied preservational condition, and (2) transverse bar deposits, which consist only of allochthonous elements showing higher mechanical degradation. The statistical distribution of the Senhaja Basin macroflora shows preominating pecopterids, accompanied by cordaitaleans and sphenopsids representing mostly hygrophilous communities, which grew in humid lowland areas. Conifer remains are rare but indicate surrounding xerophilous stands. In total, The Senhaja Basin exhibits a macroflora typical for coeval assemblages of the Late Pennsylvanian in Europe and North America."

    "title": "Application of neural architecture search in lithology identification",
    "abstract": "Identifying rock types is the essential step in geological exploration because it guides reservoir description and development planning. Conventional methods that rely on empirical correlations or elementary machine learning approaches frequently produce suboptimal outcomes under complex, multidimensional subsurface conditions. Although recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have introduced automated approaches, these often exhibit limited adaptability when confronted with intricate well-log data. To address these constraints, the present study proposes an enhanced Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework featuring an expanded search space that incorporates advanced the deep learning constructs, including one-dimensional deep neural network (DNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and Transformers. This comprehensive strategy facilitates the automated discovery of specialized network configurations specifically designed for lithology classification. Experimental findings indicate that the NAS-derived model achieves an accuracy of approximately 96% on lithology test data, underscoring its effectiveness in managing heterogeneity within complex formations. Furthermore, the incorporation of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) enhances interpretability by quantifying the contribution of each logging parameter, thereby ensuring consistency with geological reasoning. These results highlight the potential of a geoscience-adaptive NAS methodology for lithology identification by delivering improved performance, greater adaptability, and reduced reliance on exhaustive manual tuning."

    "title": "Identification of the bound and free fluid pore types in an Iranian carbonate reservoir through the integration of well logs, rock physics modeling, and 3D seismic data",
    "abstract": "Characterizing pore types in carbonate rocks is essential for understanding their reservoir properties, such as water saturation, porosity, and permeability, as well as their reservoir quality and dynamic behavior. The aim and objective of this study are primarily to identify the pore types and then, as an innovative approach, to specify whether the fluid within the pores in the reservoir is producible or remains immobile. To achieve this goal, bound and free fluid pore types are defined using nuclear magnetic resonance logs and post-stack 3D seismic data from an Iranian oil reservoir for the Main Ilam carbonate Formation. Initially, the fullset of logs for two wells (A and B) were used to determine porosity, lithology, and fluid content, followed by the nuclear magnetic resonance log to identify macro, meso, micro, and clay pore types. Subsequently, in well A, the results were validated through pore-size distribution analysis of the available core samples. Afterward, a rock physics model for carbonated rocks was used to estimate compressional velocity and density based on petrophysical evaluation and pore-type calculation. The correlation coefficients for compressional velocity in wells A and B of the Main Ilam Formation were 92% and 80%, respectively. The strong correlation among measured and modeled values verified that nuclear magnetic resonance data effectively estimates pore-type variations. Furthermore, bounded fluid was calculated based on the clay and micro pores, while free fluid was calculated based on the meso and macro pores in both wells. Finally, this information was mapped into the 3D seismic cube using inversion and multi-attribute regression analysis. Graphical abstract"

    "title": "Precise prediction of choke oil rate in critical flow condition via surface data",
    "abstract": "The rate of oil production from wells is a key element influencing the economy of oil-producing nations and corporations. Accurate estimation of choke oil flow rate from surface-related parameters are critical to production optimization of oil fields. This is the first study that addresses the challenge of accurately predicting oil production rates by utilizing various advanced machine learning methods including Random Forest, convolutional neural network, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron artificial neural network and ridge regression methods. The goal is to construct a robust framework to proficiently calculate the oil production rates of wells while taking into account tubing head pressure (THP), choke size, BS&W, gas oil ratio (GOR), and oil API. To ensure data integrity, the Leverage technique is employed to identify potential outlier data within the dataset, which consists of 195 data points. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify the relative effect of each input parameter on the oil rates. The k-fold cross-validation technique is utilized in every algorithm to mitigate the overfitting problem during the training of models. The findings indicate that Random Forest outperforms the other algorithms, reaching a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.96127 during evaluation, with the lowest error metrics. In contrast, ridge regression demonstrated a lower R 2 of 0.8666 in the evaluation phase. It is also proposed that choke size, the primary factor, THP, and API typically enhance the level of oil rate, whereas BS&W and GOR decrease the oil production rate. The novelty of this study lies in the comprehensive comparison of machine learning methods applied to real-world oil production data, with a particular focus on the impact of key well parameters on production efficiency. This approach represents a significant advancement over previous efforts in the literature, offering more accurate and reliable predictions for oil production forecasting."

    "title": "Modified leak-off equation for hydraulic fracture modelling",
    "abstract": "Carter’s equation is routinely used to describe the leak-off rate and the cumulative fluid loss during deposition of solids on porous media from a suspension. According to this equation, the leak-off rate is inversely proportional to the square root of time. This creates an unphysical singularity at time equal to zero. To remove this singularity, a modification is made to Carter’s law in this contribution. Another modification to Carter’s law made herein accounts for dynamic loss conditions where cross-flow filtration leads to only partial deposition. The modified leak-off law provides a satisfactory fit to the experimental data as long as cross flow is not turbulent. The modified leak-off law is calibrated against experimental data of an earlier study, in both static and dynamic fluid loss tests. A static fluid loss test is used to calibrate the model for the filter cake porosity and permeability as well as spurt loss. Dynamic fluid loss tests are then used to calibrate the model for the particle adhesion probability for each shear rate value."

    "title": "Comprehensive analysis of reservoir quality using microfacies and sedimentary environment characterization: insights from core and petrophysical data in early triassic gas reservoirs of the world’s largest gas field",
    "abstract": "The central Persian Gulf is of paramount economic importance as it hosts the world’s largest gas field. Within this region, the Late Permian Dalan Formation and the Early Triassic Kangan/Upper Khuff Formation act as the primary gas reservoirs. The widespread Early Triassic deposits are significant gas reservoirs not only in the central Persian Gulf but also in the Zagros Mountains of Iran and neighboring Arab nations. As global energy demand escalates, the strategic significance of this region within the hydrocarbon market necessitates a comprehensive study. Despite considerable advancements in petroleum geology and the assessment of reservoir quality, there remains a notable knowledge gap concerning the sedimentary environments and facies characteristics of these formations. An integrated approach that combines sedimentological, petrophysical, and core analysis data is essential for optimizing hydrocarbon exploration and production strategies in these reservoirs. One of the primary challenges facing Triassic gas reservoirs in the central Persian Gulf and the Middle East is the limited availability of gas extraction zones. To overcome the existing limitations, a new zoning was established based on the model of sedimentary environments and the microfacies of the studied succession. The identification of these new zones was conducted through foundational studies of the sedimentary environment, microfacies, core analysis, and petrophysical data. The conducted studies have led to the identification of new areas and an increase in gas production. Five sedimentary environments and twelve microfacies were recognized within the Early Triassic succession. The results show that the shoal environment has the highest reservoir quality, with permeability and porosity of 105.6 mD and 34.1%, respectively, establishing it as the primary reservoir. Furthermore, the tidal environment under Highstand Systems Tract (HST) conditions presents permeability and porosity values of 9.35 mD and 5.3%, introducing it as a newly identified secondary reservoir in this succession. In microfacies analysis, the dolomitic ooid grainstone microfacies demonstrates the highest reservoir quality, exhibits the highest reservoir quality, with permeability and porosity values averaging 329.96 mD and 17.2%, respectively. The ooid grainstone microfacies ranks second in reservoir quality, with permeability and porosity values of 139.45 mD and 13.2%, respectively. Both of these facies were deposited in a shoal environment. Additionally, the coarse-crystalline dolostone facies, resulting from the degradation neomorphism of carbonate sands, ranks third in reservoir quality with 83.78 mD permeability and 6.26% porosity deposited in a tidal environment. The findings of this research can be extrapolated to other carbonate reservoirs deposited in homoclinal ramp environments."

    "abstract": "A diverse assemblage of acritarchs, that represents the oldest fossil record of the Iberian Massif, is described from Ediacaran metasedimentary rocks of the Tentudía Formation included in the Ossa Morena Zone stratigraphy (Southwestern Iberia). The microfossils found include Assesserium pyramidalis , Cavaspina sp. A, Ceratosphaeridium sp. A, Dictyotidium sp. A, Multifronsphaeridium sp. A, Schizofusa zangwenlongii , Tanarium megaconicum Tanarium sp. A, and Tanarium ? sp . B, This assemblage is diagnostic of the mainly lower Ediacaran Doushantuo-Pertatataka acritarchs (c. 633—565 Ma.). The lithological diversity of the Tentudía Formation suggests that these Ediacaran sedimentary rocks were deposited in a diversity of environments (platform, slope and submarine fans, including mass transport deposits in a back-arc basin that extended into the southern part of the Central Iberian Zone. The mass transport deposits are represented in the Ossa-Morena Zone by the Salvaleón Olistostrome composed by turbidites including chert clast probably derived from the shelf. The migration of the mass transport deposits into the Central Iberian Zone (Orellana Formation) indicates the migration of the back-arc basin depocenter. Later inversion of the back-arc basin is marked by the deformation of the lower Ediacaran sedimentary rocks Serie Negra Group in the Ossa-Morena Zone and Domo Extremeño Group in the Central Iberian Zone. In the upper Ediacaran-Terreneuvian a carbonate platform (Ibor Group) was established in the southern part of the Central Iberian Zone unconformably overlying the previously deformed Domo Extremeño Group. The most proximal areas in the Ossa-Morena Zone are represented by the Malcocinado Formation which overlies the Serie Negra Group and the distal areas of the southern part of the Central Iberian Zone are represented by distal shelf and slope deposits of the Cijara Formation, which are overlain by mass transport deposits that include carbonate olistolites from the Ibor Group (such as the Fuentes and Membrillar olistostromes)."

    "abstract": "The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a sensitive marker for studying the spatial and temporal evolution of orogens. In weakly deformed rocks deposited in compressive contexts the AMS signal mostly reflects the preferential alignment and deformation of paramagnetic phyllosilicates during early layer parallel shortening (LPS) related to both near and/or far-field structures. Moreover, localized deformation and post-depositional shearing in the vicinity of thrusts can alter early LPS fabrics. An AMS analysis of 651 samples was conducted along two stratigraphic sections, Izaga and Berdún (2800 m-thick), in the Jaca-Pamplona basin (Southern Pyrenees). The sampled sections record the tectonosedimentary evolution of the basin from the Late Lutetian to the Middle Priabonian. In both sections, the magnetic fabric is controlled by LPS. The lower and upper part of the Izaga section shows triaxial to oblate and oblate ellipsoids, respectively, which are interpreted to indicate a decrease of tectonic activity associated to the Larra thrust system. The Berdún section begins with oblate ellipsoids, which subsequently become triaxial and prolate before returning oblate towards the top of the succession. Ellipsoids in the lower part of the section exhibit an incipient girdle between the minimum and intermediate axes, which signal an undetected thrust, further corroborated, by structural analysis. The remainder of the Berdún section shows a magnetic fabric derived from LPS but it is not possible to associate it to any structure. The uppermost part of the section displays prolate ellipsoids, which we link to enhanced tectonic activity leading to continentalization of the basin."

    "title": "Real-time prediction of the rate of penetration via computational intelligence: a comparative study on complex lithology in Southwest Iran",
    "abstract": "The rate of penetration (ROP) is a critical parameter for optimizing oil well drilling and the overall cost of drilling operations. In this study, five methodologies, including three artificial intelligence models (artificial neural networks [ANNs], support vector regression [SVR], random forest [RF]), a physical model, and a hybrid model, were evaluated for their ability to estimate the ROP on the basis of drilling data from a complex lithological area. The dataset utilized for model construction was derived from field data from nine wells in southern Iran. Data from wells 1 to 6 were employed for training and testing the models, and unseen data from wells 7 to 9 were used for evaluation. Following preprocessing and outlier removal, six features, namely, the flow rate (Q), weight on bit (WOB), standpipe pressure (SPP), depth, torque (T), and drill string rotation (DSR), were utilized as inputs for estimating the ROP. Sensitivity analysis was used to find the best machine learning (ML) structures. The ROP estimation on evaluation data from three unseen wells demonstrated superior performance of the hybrid model and ANN compared with the SVR, RF, and Physical Model. The hybrid model achieved metrics of RMSE 0.55, MAPE 4.61%, and correlation coefficient 0.94, showcasing its exceptional accuracy. Similarly, the ANN had root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.69, mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 5.01%, and correlation coefficients of 0.93. In contrast, the physical model showed limitations with RMSEs of 4.33, MAPEs of 10.33%, and correlation coefficients of 0.85, highlighting the need for further refinement in deterministic approaches. It is recommended that real-time ROP estimation be repeated in other areas with different hybrid methodologies and ML algorithms. This helps drilling engineers achieve better performance and reduces drilling risk. Future work could focus on addressing the computational complexity of hybrid models, which arises from sequential training steps that combine physical and ML models."

    "abstract": "The sedimentary mechanisms and depositional processes of deep-water gravity flows in lacustrine basins remain incompletely understood, posing challenges for accurate reservoir prediction in continental rift basins. This study investigates the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin to elucidate the genetic processes and evolutionary mechanisms of deep-lake gravity flow deposits. Through systematic core observations, grain size analysis (including mean size, sorting, skewness and kurtosis), and sedimentary facies analysis, we identified four distinct gravity flow types: (1) sandy debris flows, (2) muddy debris flows, (3) turbidity currents, and (4) slumps. Quantitative grain size parameters reveal significant differences among these facies, with mean grain size ranging from 1.19Φ to 3.53Φ. Three primary triggering mechanisms are recognized: seismic events (seismites), volcanic events (tuffaceous layers), and anoxic events (\"Zhangjiatan\" shales), with seismic and volcanic events exerting particularly strong influences. A new depositional pattern is proposed, detailing the complete evolutionary sequence from slope failure initiation to final deposition, encompassing the sliding-slumping-debris flow-turbidity current transition. This study advances understanding by: (1) establishing quantitative discriminators for different gravity flow types, (2) clarifying the causal relationships between external triggers and flow deposition, and (3) providing a comprehensive evolutionary framework for lacustrine gravity flow systems. These findings significantly enhance the ability to predict deep-lacustrine sedimentary architectures and hydrocarbon reservoirs, offering valuable insights for exploration in analogous rift basins."

    "title": "Exploration of blockage and release blockage mechanism of porous media under the influence of SC-CO2-high pour point oil permeation fluid system",
    "abstract": "The evaluation of separated wax-solid and its impact on reservoir permeability has long posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, most experimental methods have relied on an independent set of medium injection sequence, which cannot isolate the effects of wax-solid deposition alone. Although the use of two-dimensional models combined with high-speed cameras provides some insights into wax-solid deposition, current pressure equipment limitations prevent comprehensive analysis. This study addresses this gap by focusing on wax-solid deposition under higher pressure conditions. An innovative approach is introduced through a parallel comparison method employing artificial rock cores as carriers, which effectively eliminates interference from irreducible water and residual oil. Experimental results demonstrate that high-pressure reservoir damage occurs in 12-meter slim tube and 0.5-meter spliced core. Chromatographic analysis on collected oil samples led to the design of two composite core displacement experiments at pressures of 35 MPa and 53 MPa. Results show that the third and eighth cores in both group A and group B experienced the most substantial damage, with levels reaching 97.9% and 86.7%, respectively. Ultimately, the permeability of the advantageous channel decreased by 87.5% in group A and 67.0% in group B, mainly due to blockage and release mechanisms working together. In conclusion, the new experimental design significantly enhances deposition observation by enabling precise capture accuracy and practical applicability, offering valuable insights into permeability changes caused by wax-solid deposition."

This study comprehensively evaluates machine learning models, utilizing a real-time, high-resolution dataset from drilling operations in southeast Iraq. Among the models tested, the Random Forest algorithm demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving an R 2 of 0.955, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.119, and an Average Absolute Relative Error (AARE%) of 7.683, highlighting its reliability and robustness in predicting ROP. Sensitivity analysis and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) also identified fracture pressure, kinematic viscosity, and rotary speed (RPM) as the most influential parameters affecting ROP. While alternative methods like Decision Tree and AdaBoost showed signs of overfitting, the results emphasize the Random Forest model’s superiority in balancing accuracy and generalizability. This research underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing drilling performance, offering significant implications for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Matrix acidizing, a vital well stimulation technique, can be severely impaired by formation damage resulting from acid-crude oil emulsions, asphaltene sludge, and ferric ion precipitation. This study presents a systematic investigation into the simultaneous prevention of these issues through the evaluation and optimization of various acidizing additives under simulated reservoir conditions (366.5 K). Employing a Middle Eastern crude oil sample, laboratory tests were conducted to assess sludge formation (quantified by mass and a newly introduced average particle size metric), emulsion stability, corrosion rates on N80 steel, iron precipitation, and additive compatibility. The novelty of this work lies in its comprehensive analysis of the combined effects of multiple additives on sludge formation, beyond conventional anti-emulsion and anti-sludge agents, and the introduction of average sludge particle size as a critical indicator of formation damage. The findings reveal that while individual additives (corrosion inhibitor, corrosion inhibitor intensifier, iron control agents, non-ionic surfactant, and anti-emulsion agent) offer varying degrees of sludge reduction, their synergistic combination in 15 wt.% HCl significantly decreased sludge particle mass by 52% and average particle size by 87%. Notably, ferric ions exhibited the most detrimental impact, increasing sludge mass over twofold and average size tenfold. The optimized acidizing fluid, comprising 2 v./v.% corrosion inhibitor and 1.5 v./v.% corrosion inhibitor intensifier, effectively prevented ferric ion precipitation and minimized emulsion and sludge formation, achieving a remarkably low corrosion rate of 0.001 mg/cm², well below the critical limit. However, achieving consistently complete sludge prevention proved complex and often necessitated the inclusion of a particularly effective anti-sludge agent. This research establishes a comprehensive methodology for designing effective and compatible acidizing fluids to mitigate multiple formation damage mechanisms, with the average sludge particle size providing a novel and sensitive parameter for evaluation.

    "abstract": "Enhancing oil recovery (EOR) is critical for maximizing hydrocarbon extraction from reservoirs, yet conventional methods often face limitations in efficiency. In recent years, nanoparticles have been increasingly applied to enhance oil recovery techniques due to their unique properties. This study proposes surface-modified zinc oxide nanocomposites (ZLO) at an optimized concentration as a novel EOR agent. The performance of ZLO was systematically evaluated and compared with conventional zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO) under identical experimental configurations replicating reservoir conditions. This investigation employed a comprehensive suite of characterization techniques, including wettability alteration analysis, interfacial tension measurements, and zeta potential determination, to evaluate the nanofluid’s properties. The main novelties of this study are: (1) its identification of the optimal concentration of ZLO and ZnO; and (2) performing recovery factor determination through spontaneous imbibition at real reservoir conditions. Following the examination of ZnO and ZLO nanocomposite crystalline structures, the ZnO and ZLO nanofluids were used at concentrations ranging between 5 and 30 ppm to determine the optimum concentration of each material. Comprehensive analysis of colloidal stability (via zeta potential) and wettability modification (via contact angle) revealed that 10 ppm represented the optimum concentration for both ZnO and ZLO nanoparticles in EOR applications. At 10 ppm, the contact angle and zeta potential reached (59.28°, -31.38 mV) and (41.04°, -42.78 mV) for ZnO and ZLO, respectively. After 15 days of imbibition operations, the oil recovery factors for the base, ZnO, and ZLO solutions were 24.95%, 35.74%, and 62.41%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Smart Chemical Modifier (SeMAR) is a crucial enhanced oil recovery technique for petroleum production, particularly in the heterogeneous sandstone system. This study focuses on the application of SeMAR for enhancing oil recovery in the Hemiar oilfield, located in the Masila Basin of Eastern Yemen. In the Hemiar oilfield, the S2 sandstone reservoir presents complex mineralogy due the depositional and diagenetic processes, exhibiting low permeability system. The aim of the current study was to assess the influence of SeMAR on the behavior of the heavy oil collected from 19 core samples in diffrent burial depths in the Hemiar-21exploration well. In this case, different chemical formulations of the SeMAR were used to achieve a precise the efficiency of heavy oil displacement using different laboratory tests such as phase behavior, compatibility, spontaneous imbibition, emulsion viscosity measurement, and core rock stability. The highlighted results demonstrate that the SeMAR formulations improve the efficiency of heavy oil displacement from the heterogeneous sandstone reservoir system in the Hemiar Field, particularly 1% S16A formulation. The 1% S16A was the most effective surfactant, exhibiting the lowest viscosity (7.0 cp.) at a 50% oil concentration, which enhanced the oil mobility and recovery efficiency. The results of this study provide promising insights into the optimization of SeMAR formulations to maximize oil recovery in the Hemiar Field, with a relatively high oil recovery factor, reaching up to 25%."

    "title": "Adjacent well separation factor algorithm considering the influence of error ellipsoid envelope",
    "abstract": "To achieve efficient hydrocarbon resource development, cluster wells and infill wells are increasingly utilized in directional drilling projects. During the design and construction phases of such projects, the separation factor calculation serves as a critical step for collision avoidance management. Although various methods for computing separation factors have been developed, most existing approaches—including the SPE-WPTS-recommended method—consider only the error ellipsoids at designated reference well points and the closest points of offset wells, neglecting the error ellipsoid envelope. This oversight likely leads to an underestimation of collision risks. Building on the SPE-WPTS algorithm, this study proposes a novel separation factor calculation method that incorporates the error ellipsoid envelope, termed the ‌error envelope separation factor‌. The method approximates segments of wellbore trajectories as elliptical cylinders and constructs parametric equations using analytical geometry. Distance uncertainty is quantified via projections of these cylinders along the direction from a specified point on the reference well to the nearest point on the offset well. Example calculations show that when the reference well is parallel to the offset well, the error envelope separation coefficient has the same calculation result as the separation coefficient recommended by SPE-WPTS. As the degree of non-parallelism between the reference and offset wells increases, the difference between the error envelope separation coefficient and the separation coefficient recommended by SPE-WPTS becomes larger and larger. At this time, it is more scientific to apply the error envelope separation factor. The main contribution of this study is that the proposed method of calculating the error envelope separation factor improves the accuracy of wellbore collision risk prediction, and the proposed algorithm for the uncertainty of the distance between two wellbore points is also important for well spacing optimization."

    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is widely used to enhance hydrocarbon production in low-permeability reservoirs, but its application in loosely cemented sandstone reservoirs presents unique challenges. These formations exhibit high pore permeability and low rock strength, making frac-packing susceptible to fracture conductivity damage. To address this, a novel experimental framework was developed to investigate the combined effects of proppant compression, embedment, and fines migration under varying closure pressures. Experimental results demonstrate a significant decline in fracture conductivity with increasing closure stress, primarily governed by closure pressure, proppant size, and formation strength. Over time, fines migration into the packed proppant bed further reduces fracture conductivity. Based on these findings, an integrated fracture conductivity model for weakly consolidated sandstone reservoirs was developed and validated through its application in the Bohai oilfield. Quantitatively, conductivity loss was attributed to proppant compression (34%), embedment into the fracture face (19%), and fines plugging (23%), resulting in an overall reduction of approximately 59%. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the coupled mechanisms driving fracture conductivity degradation in frac-packing wells. Key recommendations include selecting larger proppant sizes, maintaining an initial fracture width of at least 12.5 mm, and controlling early production rates to minimize conductivity loss. The proposed model and findings contribute to improving frac-packing design and performance in unconsolidated sandstone formations."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the key factors influencing the emulsification of oil-water emulsions in alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding wells using a high-pressure electric field separation approach. The research examines how oil-water emulsions respond to demulsification under high-voltage conditions and identifies the challenges associated with emulsion separation in oilfield operations. These findings provide valuable technical insights for optimizing the treatment of produced wastewater in oilfields. The results indicate that when sodium chloride concentrations exceed 3000 mg/L, the efficiency of electroseparation declines. Furthermore, introducing nanoparticles extends the time required for emulsion separation under an electric field. A critical threshold is identified when nano-ferrous sulfide concentrations surpass 0.05% and sodium chloride levels exceed 1600 mg/L, marking the limit for effective electroseparation. Additionally, an increase in colloid and asphaltene content negatively impacts the separation process. However, hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and heavy alkylbenzene sulfonate (HABS) exhibit a relatively small influence on the electroseparation efficiency of the emulsion."

    "abstract": "Carbonate formations, known for their complex characteristics, require detailed internal heterogeneity knowledge for effective exploration and production. This study presents an integrated workflow to investigate heterogeneity at different scales, from microscopic to log level, in southwest Iran wells. Geological settings were studied, including depositional systems, structural elements, field stresses, diagenesis, and facies variations. Conventional petrophysical evaluation determined lithologies, porosity, and fluid types/content. Statistical methods such as Lorenz curves, semivariance analysis, and the coefficient of variation were used to analyze porosity heterogeneity. Image processing (segmentation) analyzed petrographic images to identify rock matrix and pore spaces. Image logs from oil-based microimagers and ultrasonic borehole imagers showed variations in porosity, fracture networks, zonation, and stress directions. Nuclear magnetic resonance log provided porosity types and sizes. We evaluated vertical and lateral heterogeneities across different zones and wells. This study’s results show that a multi-scale workflow is essential for accurately characterizing reservoir heterogeneity in carbonate fields. The analysis effectively identifies sedimentological and structural influences, quantifies heterogeneity, and ranks zones based on their heterogeneity. The models developed through this workflow enhance decision-making in reservoir characterization and offer practical applications for field studies. Despite limitations like imaging resolution and data availability, this approach remains integral to advancing the understanding of heterogeneity and guiding further improvements. Graphical abstract"

To address this gap, this method explores alternative approaches to estimate rock strength using minimum data. A novel 3D rock strength prediction model that integrates geostatistic with deep learning algorithms is proposed. Initially, the deep learning model is trained using the available dataset to capture the complex nonlinear relationships within the data. The developed model is used to increase the dataset size by focusing on nearby data points to mitigate geological variability. geostatistic methods are then applied to establish spatial correlations of rock strength across an extended range compared with those of the actual dataset. The results reveal marked improvements in both the prediction range and spatial resolution of rock strength through the proposed methodology. The developed deep learning models achieved coefficient of determination values ranging from 0.9 to 0.99, demonstrating excellent predictive capability. Cross-validation confirms the model effectively captures local variations. The prediction range in the field expanded by 250% compared to the initial dataset, successfully addressing areas that previously exhibited flat readings when the model was applied to the initial data. This study advances petroleum industry knowledge by integrating deep learning and geostatistical methods to overcome rock strength prediction limitations in nonreservoir formations. The novel 3D model enhances the prediction range and spatial resolution, addresses data gaps and enables better decision-making for areas with limited wireline data."

    "title": "Synchronous impact of divalent ions on formation damage and wettability alteration during smart water injection: static and dynamic assessment",
    "abstract": "Smart water injection into oil fields is an efficient EOR method but has significant challenges due to incompatibility between the formation brine and the injecting water. The presence of reactive ions in smart water can change the wettability of reservoir rock to increase oil production. However, the possibility of formation damage due to inorganic scales may increase. In this research, static and dynamic experiments were conducted to investigate the competition between rock wettability alteration and formation damage due to smart water injection. The experiments were performed in two parts including waters compatibility tests and rock wettability measurements for various concentrations of potential-determining ions in smart water. The crystal size and morphology of the sulfate scales were inspected visually using scanning electron microscopy images. In static compatibility tests, the maximum amount of sulfate scales was detected in the mixture containing 40% injection water. The experimental data indicated that the simultaneous increase in the concentration of sulfate and magnesium ions improves the carbonate rock wettability 18% more compared to increasing sulfate concentration alone. As a result, SW_1Ca.2 Mg.1.5S revealed the highest effect on rock wettability changes from oil-wet to water-wet conditions in both static and dynamic tests. The formation damage analysis through core-flooding experiments showed that increasing the concentration of sulfate ions twice the sea water causes an 88% reduction in core permeability. However, doubling the magnesium concentration in the presence of sulfate ions reduces the permeability decline to 77%. The maximum recovery factor (i.e., 35%) was attained by injecting SW_1Ca.2 Mg.1.5S into the carbonate core, and core permeability was enhanced twofold. The findings show that simultaneous changes in the concentration of potential-determining ions in smart water, in addition to increasing oil production, also prevent formation damage, which is often neglected in previous studies."

    "title": "Investigation on the adsorption and surface activity of imidazolium chloride-based ionic liquids (n = 12, 18); resin and asphaltene synthetic oil and high salinity",
    "abstract": "Unfortunately, there is no report regarding the impact of resin and asphaltene on surfactant adsorption and interfacial tension (IFT) reduction especially in the presence of ionic liquids (ILs) as a new class of surfactants. In this way, the current study is designed and performed for the first time to investigate the effects of resinous and asphaltenic synthetic oils from acidic and basic crude oils on the adsorption of two ILs namely 1-dodecyl 3-methyl imidazolium chloride ([C 12 mim][Cl]), and 1-octadecyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride ([C 18 mim][Cl]) under high salinity condition of 210,000 ppm of NaCl and the IFT variation. Moreover, the effect of pH in the range of 3.5–11 on the IFT, and adsorption of the ILs on the carbonate rock surface was examined. The obtained results revealed the undeniable impact of alkyl chain length on the IFT reduction to a minimum value of 0.07 mN/m for basic resinous synthetic oil (BRSO) and [C 18 mim][Cl]. The results also revealed the higher adsorption of surfactants in the presence of resin molecules (1.64 mg IL/g rock for BRSO at pH of 11) due to their more branched structure. Moreover, the higher adsorption of ILs for the asphaltenic synthetic oil (ASO) and resinous synthetic oil (RSO) extracted from the basic crude oil at a pH of 7 was observed which was related to the higher content of heteroatoms (RSO = 18.5% and ASO = 23.6% for synthetic oil extracted from basic crude oil). Finally, the obtained results (IFT values and IL adsorption values) were used to select the optimum chemical formulation for core flooding experiments. The performed core flooding experiments revealed the maximum tertiary oil recovery of about 12.5% based on the original oil in place (OOIP)."

    "title": "Diminishing the mobility ratio and interfacial tension of a tertiary flooded sandstone reservoir using microparticles as a reinforcement agent with biopolymer composite",
    "abstract": "Approaches for enhancing oil recovery are important for maximizing the recovery factor of oil after the vanishing natural pressure of a hydrocarbon reservoir. This study attempted to boost the oil recovery factor at the expense of the saturation of remaining oil after a secondary flood using xanthan gum and its modified form through blending with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), where their effectiveness was evaluated. To evaluate the effect of MCC on native biopolymer, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), interfacial tension (ITF), and rheological studies were assessed. The results indicated that MCC enhanced the rheology properties of the biopolymers. It also reduced the interfacial force between crude oil and polymer slug solution (12.54 mN/m) more than the formation water (18.8 mN/m) and biopolymer solution alone (16.28 mN/m). Full reservoir conditions (confining pressure, reservoir temperature, and actual oil) were applied in this work on two subsurface core samples (A&B), trying to enhance the oil recovery. The original oil in place was evaluated for the reservoir core samples (50.9% p.v. & 60.3% p.v. for A & B, respectively), and the oil permeabilities were 81.6 & 80.97 md at the residual water saturation recorded as the base permeability. To assess the residual oil saturation, the secondary flooding using formation water was carried out up to the stage of no more oil displaced out of the tested samples, where the permeability of water at the residual oil saturation was measured 6.05 & 7.5 md for A & B, respectively. Finally, plug samples were flooded chemically, and additional oil recovery was recorded. The flooding experiments indicated that the MCC with xanthan gum was more effective for enhancing the oil recovery factor (29.09% S or ) than that of the native biopolymer separately (20% S or ), this is due to its higher viscosity, higher ability for IFT reduction, and better emulsion stability. The article’s innovation lies in proving that the presence of microcrystalline cellulose supports the performance of xanthan gum as an enhanced oil recovery agent in severe conditions of oil reservoirs."

    "title": "An integrated petrographic and petrophysical study of diagenetic controls on elastic response in heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs",
    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive petrographic and petrophysical methodology aimed at quantitatively assessing the influence of diagenetic processes on the elastic properties of the Asmari carbonate reservoir. Thirty core plugs from five wells (A-E) underwent CT-scan imaging to reconstruct pore and fracture geometries with high resolution, in addition to transmitted-light and SEM-EDS petrography, helium porosimetry, mercury injection, gas and Klinkenberg permeability tests, and ultrasonic P- and S-wave velocity measurements. The dataset, consisting of 28 plugs for elastic testing, yields average P- and S-wave velocities of 2,880 m/s and 1,675 m/s, respectively. Regression analysis indicates a strong negative correlation (R 2 = 0.85, p < 0.01) between total porosity and P-wave velocity. Principal component analysis (PCA) identifies two components that capture 62% (PC1) and 14% (PC2) of the variance. Cementation and dolomitization exhibit positive loading on PC1 (> 0.75), resulting in 8–12% increases in elastic moduli, while dissolution and fracturing load negatively, leading to reductions in velocities of 10–15%. PCA highlights cementation and dolomitization as critical factors for mechanical stiffening, whereas dissolution and fracturing decrease seismic velocities. Interpolating the resultant PC score grids generates depth-dependent diagenetic–elasticity maps that clarify the spatial variability of these factors within stratigraphic frameworks, providing essential parameters for seismic inversion and reservoir simulation, and enhancing seismic impedance and amplitude versus offset (AVO) facies predictions by approximately 10% compared to conventional workflows. These findings demonstrate that quantitative diagenetic indices can be directly linked to elastic-property variations and deployed as seismic-inversion attributes. These results highlight the significant role of diagenetic processes in governing reservoir heterogeneity and quality, emphasizing the imperative to integrate advanced petrographic characterization with quantitative petrophysical data for robust reservoir evaluation. By elucidating spatial heterogeneity and elastic property variations, this investigation advances the understanding of carbonate reservoir behavior and informs strategic approaches to optimize hydrocarbon recovery in geologically complex environments."

    "title": "Assessing pore quality impact on saturation exponent and water saturation calculation",
    "abstract": "The saturation exponent is one of the most important parameters needed to calculate water saturation in Archie’s equation. Generally, the saturation exponent is considered constant, but not all depth intervals have the same characteristics. This study aims to investigate the relationship between rock quality and the saturation exponent, a critical parameter in Archie’s equation for water saturation calculation. Given that rock texture and pore characteristics vary significantly with depth, assuming a constant saturation exponent can lead to inaccurate results. The study integrates core analysis and petrographic data to classify rock quality and its relationship with the saturation exponent. R t and R o data from core analysis are used to determine saturation exponent. Furthermore, rock quality is identified using the hydraulic flow unit concept by constructing log-log plots of reservoir quality index and pore volume to grain volume ratio. Several pore attribute parameters, such as the combination of shape factor and tortuosity (Kozeny’s constant), specific surface area, reservoir quality index, and clay volume, are examined for their influence on the saturation exponent. The saturation exponent shows strong correlation with Kozeny’s constant and clay volume. An empirical equation was developed to estimate the saturation exponent based on these parameters. Using this empirical equation, the saturation exponent can be estimated across depth intervals, leading to more accurate water saturation calculations. This study offers a practical method to estimate saturation exponent variation using readily available log-derived parameters. It contributes to more reliable determination of saturation exponent variation and enhances the accuracy of water saturation calculations in heterogeneous formations."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the optimization of condensate recovery in a retrograde gas reservoir, where production efficiency is hindered by complex interactions between subsurface and surface processes. Accurate modeling of these interactions is essential for reliable production forecasting and economic assessment. This research compares the efficacy of two simulation methodologies: (1) standalone reservoir modeling and (2) integrated modeling encompassing the reservoir, wells, pipelines, and surface facilities under various gas reinjection and production scenarios. Key economic metrics, including Net Present Value (NPV) and Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR), are employed to assess scenario feasibility and identify optimal recovery strategies. The findings demonstrate that integrated modeling significantly enhances production forecasts' accuracy by capturing interdependencies often neglected in standalone models. Specifically, optimized gas reinjection in the integrated model resulted in a 15% increase in condensate recovery and improved reservoir pressure maintenance, thereby facilitating sustained productivity. Economically, integrated simulations yielded an NPV up to 10% higher than the standalone approach under optimal reinjection conditions, indicating enhanced economic resilience to market fluctuations. Through this methodology, the study provides a more comprehensive framework for evaluating technical and economic performance in gas condensate reservoir management, offering refined tools for informed decision-making in complex field operations."

    "abstract": "Drilling is one of the most crucial operations in the petroleum industry, hence the prediction of drilling performance is important for cost and efficiency estimation in project designing. Based on the field data collected from a vertical well in Xinjiang province, a drilling performance prediction function was trained by BP-ANN (back-propagation artificial neural network). The input parameters of this function consist of mineral composition and operating factors. Predicting drilling performance from the combination of mineral composition and operating factors is a typical multivariate nonlinear fitting problem. BP - ANN has extremely high accuracy in solving similar problems, so the widely used back - propagation artificial neural network was selected. According to the training and testing results, the introduction of mineral composition can effectively improve the training speed and testing accuracy. Through the established prediction function, a dynamic optimization algorithm combined with DOE (Design of Experiments) theory was also developed. This algorithm sets independent optimization strategies for different drilling performances (ROP(rate of penetration), drill diameter, inclination, azimuth) and reduces the number of tests for finding the best drilling performance. The optimization effect is obvious, with the ROP increased by 408% and the inclination decreased by 67%."

    "title": "Cooperative control method for multi-agent ground fracturing truck group based on offline reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "The increasing scale of unconventional oil and gas resource development has driven the demand for complex fracturing technologies. Due to their high value and energy consumption, the operational efficiency of fracturing units directly impacts the overall fracturing production efficiency. Currently, the control of fracturing units mainly relies on manual experience, where experts allocate displacement for each fracturing truck based on total displacement requirements, which is then directly converted into pump speeds according to pre-set rules. However, this manual decision-making pattern often exhibits insufficient collaborative capability when confronted with complex construction scenarios. Furthermore, due to the lack of autonomous decision-making ability in concrete fracturing trucks, timely responses to unexpected failures are challenging. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning based pump injection coordination control method to autonomously compute the optimal pump speeds for each fracturing truck in real time. The core of this method is an improved algorithm based on the TD3, which is enhanced by the incorporation of the CQL algorithm to improve the stability of the collaborative control strategy. A standardized pump injection control sequence dataset was constructed to verify the proposed method. And the experimental results illustrates that the average deviation between the calculated optimal pump speeds from the proposed method and the historical data is less than 8%, indicating that the proposed method can effectively mine the historical pump data and achieve expert-level control capability. Furthermore, the proposed method has been experimentally compared with both classical and cutting-edge models of machine learning and reinforcement learning, resulting in 37.5% to 48.6% reductions in pump speed deviation. It evidences the superiority of the proposed method within the realm of collaborative sequential decision making, showcasing its capability to achieve autonomous decision-making and coordinated control among multiple fracturing trucks. However, due to the limited data, the agents may have limited generalizability to different fracturing truck fleet configurations. Additionally, while the method shows promise in specific contexts, further online learning will be necessary for real-world deployment to adapt the agents to site-specific conditions."

    "abstract": "The Sarvak Formation in the Yadavaran oilfield within the Zagros Basin is a significant hydrocarbon reservoir characterized by complex sedimentological and diagenetic features influencing its reservoir quality. This study aims to investigate the sedimentological facies and diagenetic processes within the Sarvak Formation to enhance understanding of its reservoir potential. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using core samples, thin-section petrography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The primary objectives included identifying distinct facies assemblages and correlating them with diagenetic alterations. The results indicate the presence of three key facies: lagoonal facies, characterized by fine-grained, bioturbated sediments with a high organic content, exhibiting a porosity of approximately 15–20%; open marine facies, consisting of well-sorted, coarse-grained sands with a lower organic content and porosity ranging from 10 to 12%; and transitional facies, which display mixed characteristics of both lagoonal and open marine environments, with porosity values between 12 and 18%. The integration of advanced analytical techniques, including SEM and XRD, provided detailed insights into mineralogical composition and microstructural features, highlighting the impact of diagenetic processes on reservoir quality. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the Sarvak Formation’s reservoir characteristics, offering valuable insights for hydrocarbon exploration and production strategies in the Zagros Basin."

    "abstract": "The employment of toxic, hazardous, and environmentally damaging inhibitors poses a major risk to both the environment and public health. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in using phytochemical-rich natural extracts as environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors and expensive, non-corrosive coating materials to safeguard metallic structures of significant commercial value. Functionalization of the tikoua extract with nanomaterials such as ZnO, CuO, and Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and their composites was studied as a corrosion inhibitor of carbon steel in acid corrosion media. Weight loss measurements, scanning electron microscope, and atomic absorption spectroscopy have been used to explore the inhibitory effects of the synthesized composites. The components of the synthesized composite inhibitors were characterized using a GC-MS analysis which identified major phytochemical constituents, such as octacosane, vitamin E, and α-sitosterol, that contribute to corrosion inhibition. Particle size analysis showed nanocomposites in the 204–416 nm range. SEM confirmed substantial surface protection, especially with ZnO. Multiple measurements revealed that these composites adsorb tightly on the carbon steel surface to prevent corrosion in carbon steel. It was observed that the inhibition efficiency increases as the plant extract concentration rises to 53% at 1000 ppm. Results show that ficus extract inhibited the acid corrosion of carbon steel and the inhibition performance was enhanced in the presence of nanoparticles. It was found that ZnO gave the best results. By using 100 ppm ZnO Nanomaterial with plant extract the inhibition efficiency reaches 87.43%. The purpose of this paper is to clarify how effective plant extract with nanomaterials is at protecting steel from acidic environments."

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating the Rate of Penetration (ROP) in drilling operations remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of traditional approaches, which are often characterized by low accuracy and reliance on empirical equations with assumed coefficients. These methods, while optimized for specific fields, often fail to generalize across different geological contexts. To address these gaps, this study proposes an innovative machine learning-driven framework for ROP prediction, employing advanced algorithms such as Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). To further enhance model performance, metaheuristic optimization strategies such as the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are integrated. Among the tested models, the LSSVM-CSA framework achieved the best results, with a remarkable R-squared (R 2 ) value of 92.55, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.98. These results underscore the superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability of the proposed methodology. By learning from the unique characteristics of each field during training, the models provide enhanced predictive capabilities and operational flexibility. The dataset, sourced from the Fahliyan Formation in southern Iran, demonstrates the practical applicability of the approach in real-world drilling operations. This study addresses the limitations of traditional methods, highlights the benefits of integrating machine learning with metaheuristic optimization, and provides actionable insights for advancing drilling efficiency, minimizing operational costs, and enabling data-driven decision-making in the petroleum industry."

    "abstract": "The petroleum industry is challenged by high energy consumption in large-scale hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) removal from crude oil. This study explores crude oil stripping of H 2 S in straight and serpentine microchannels, providing mass transfer correlations for the process. The influence of various operating parameters such as crude oil temperature (T oil =20–40 °C), crude oil flow rate (Q oil =50–120 mL/min) and natural gas flow rate (Q gas =200–1200 mL/min) on mass transfer characteristics of H 2 S, pressure drop and specific energy consumption (S.E.C) are investigated. The results show that increasing T oil and Q gas and reduction in Q oil is conducive to enhancing liquid-side mass transfer coefficient (K L a) and stripping efficiency, with maximum values of 1.4 (1/s) and 78.6%, respectively. The mass transfer characteristics and pressure drop in the serpentine microchannel are 10–25% and 2.5–10.4% more than the straight one, respectively. The efficient ranges of operating parameters (Q oil =90–120 mL/min, Q gas =200–450 mL/min and T oil =20–40 °C) are determined to minimize S.E.C and obtain the highest performance ratio (η = 1.18) of the serpentine microchannel. Correlations using the experimental results are obtained to find Sherwood number (Sh L ) and K L a. The average absolute deviation (AAD %) between predicted values and experimental data is under 6.6% for both straight and serpentine microchannels. This study advances the development of these T-junction microchannels for crude oil stripping from H 2 S, considering specific energy consumption and operational constraints."

    "title": "Well pattern adjustment of variable-injection-production-rate waterflooding in high water-cut oilfields",
    "abstract": "Using fixed well patterns and constant water injection rates over extended periods in multilayered sandstone reservoirs often leads to uneven performance across different layers. Some layers may be over-saturated with water, while others may not be sufficiently swept, resulting in inefficient oil recovery. Furthermore, this causes poor overall utilization of the reservoir, with certain areas left upswept. To improve waterflooding efficiency and improve oil recovery, this study presents two well pattern adjustment methods that employ variable injection and production rates constraints: Rotational Injection and Rotational Production (RIRP) and Zonal Injection and Rotational Production (ZIRP). The effectiveness of these methods was demonstrated through pore-scale experiments and numerical reservoir simulations. Results show that at a reservoir scale, RIRP changes how water flows by creating pressure changes over time, facilitating fluid movement between and within each layer more effectively. At pore scale, both RIRP and ZIRP increase capillary forces, which help redistribute oil and water in the rock pores. Compared to the traditional commingled injection and zonal production (CIZP) method, RIRP and ZIRP perform better, increasing oil recovery by 3–7.6% and reducing water cut by 1.6–11.5%. This study also presents three operating cycles for each of the RIRP and ZIRP methods. Field data show that these techniques can significantly increase oil production, making them effective options for improving oil recovery in mature reservoirs during high water cut periods."

    "abstract": "In this study, four oil seepages and ten organic-rich shale samples of the Paleocene Waipawa Formation from outcrop sections in East Coast Basin, New Zealand were studied. Multi-scale organic geochemical analyses, including total organic carbon (TOC) content, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, biomarker and carbon isotope measurements were conducted and used to determine the characteristics of the organic matter in seep oil and shale samples and then to learn more about their genetic relationship. The studied Waipawa shale samples are characterized by high TOC content up to 10.84wt. %, and mixed kerogen types, with mainly hydrogen-rich kerogen Types II and II/III, suggesting a good oil- and gas- source rock, with substantial potential for oil generation. The studied Waipawa shale sediments are characterized by Pr/Ph ratios between 0.90 and 3.40 and generally low values of C 32 R/C 30 hopane ratio of less than 1, indicating that these shale sediments are clay-rich facies and were deposited under anoxic to relatively oxic environmental conditions. The shale sediments of the Waipawa Formation are also characterzied by high ratios of C 23 tri/C 24 tri, C 25 tri/C 26 tri, and C 24 tre/C 22 tri tricyclic terpanes, alongside high abundance of C 27 and C 29 regular steranes compared to C 28 regular sterane, further indicating a mixed organic matter, with high contributions of marine organic matter input. The high contributions of marine organic matter during the formation of the studied Waipawa shale succession are further corroborated by the outcome of carbon isotopes. The source and depositional-related biomarker ratios and parameters also show a good genetic relationship between the Waipawa shale source rock and those of the studied seep oil samples. However, the studied oil seepages are more mature than the Waipawa shale from the outcrop sections, exhibiting a range of early-mature to peak-mature of oil window, and thus the shale source rock of the Waipawa Formation contributed to these seep oils in the deeper stratigraphic sequence. Thereby, the intensive oil exploration of the Waipawa shale source rock is recommended in the deeper structural units of the East Coast Basin."

    "abstract": "Wellhead pressure is a critical parameter in hydraulic fracturing, as excessive pressure poses significant risks to equipment, such as pump trucks, and personnel, potentially leading to operational hazards and accidents. Therefore, effective reduction of wellhead pressure is essential for ensuring safe and efficient fracturing operations. Previous studies have discussed various methods for reducing wellhead pressure, such as chemical drag reducers and lowering fracture pressure. However, these discussions are not comprehensive. This study provides a systematic review of existing research on reducing wellhead pressure during hydraulic fracturing. By analyzing the fundamental relationships among wellhead pressure, hydrostatic column pressure, frictional drag, and bottom-hole pressure, this paper summarize methods to lower wellhead pressure, including reducing friction, optimizing fracturing fluid properties, and decreasing fracture pressure. Based on the different types of friction encountered during the fracturing process, various methods to mitigate excessive wellhead pressure are systematically summarized, analyzed, and compared in terms of their underlying principles, advantages, and limitations. The research progress of each method is summarized, case studies are compared and quantified, a recommended sequence for applying these methods is proposed, and potential areas for further research are identified."

    "abstract": "The significant heterogeneity of sandstone and mudstone interbedded reservoirs complicates the accurate evaluation of formation brittleness, thereby affecting the optimization of fracturing stage design. This paper first derives a statistical damage constitutive model to predict rock stress-strain curves under in-situ conditions, and the application of the model has been validated by experimental results. It then develops an energy-based brittleness evaluation procedure that accounts for the effects of lithology, physical properties and in-situ conditions on rock brittleness at a logging scale. The results indicate that highly brittle rocks can store significant elastic energy during loading and release it abruptly without requiring additional energy input. Rocks with a low Young’s modulus can exhibit high brittleness, as the post-peak mechanical behavior of rock controls its overall brittleness. As confining pressure increases, the brittleness of rocks decreases, rocks with the same Young’s modulus exhibits a 44.4% increase in brittleness when confining pressure decreases by 20 MPa. The newly proposed method effectively evaluates the reservoir energy-based brittleness index at the logging scale. This evaluation method is more sensitive to strongly heterogeneous formations and is more objective considering the cumulative impact of internal and external conditions without biased energy weighting."

    "title": "Geochemical characterisation and petroleum potential of selected cenozoic coals from Sarawak basin, Malaysia",
    "abstract": "Previous geochemical analyses of crude oils from offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, suggest a dominant terrestrial organic matter source, likely deposited in peatland environments. To investigate this hypothesis, forty Cenozoic humic coals from Mukah-Balingian and Merit-Pila coalfields in the Sarawak Basin were examined using an integrated suite of bulk and molecular geochemical analytical techniques, including Rock-Eval pyrolysis, pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC), attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The objectives were to evaluate thermal maturity, organic matter input, and hydrocarbon generation potential. The huminite/vitrinite reflectance (0.27–0.43%R o ), T max (383–428 °C), hydrogen index (68–456 mgHC/g TOC), A -factor (0.4–0.6), extract yield (21596–224779 ppm) data, together with the prevalence of hopenes and hopanes, collectively indicate thermal immaturity and an excellent potential for gas and mixed oil/gas generation. Rock-Eval, Py-GC, and source-related aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon proxies suggest a dominance of type-III kerogen with varying amounts of type-II kerogen. Notably, the Merit-Pila coals exhibited the highest hydrocarbon-generating potential, while the Mukah coals displayed a greater abundance of type-II kerogen and marine algal organic matter. However, despite variations in organic matter composition, principal component analysis revealed no significant correlation between source input and petroleum potential. These findings underscore the importance of prioritising deeper offshore equivalents of the studied coals and coaly sequences as probable source rocks for ongoing and future exploration efforts in the Sarawak Basin. Additionally, closed-system pyrolysis of the coals is recommended for more accurately modelling of petroleum generation and expulsion."

    "title": "Water saturation modeling in carbonate reservoirs using the bulk volume water approach",
    "abstract": "An ideal Saturation Height Function (SHF) should account for rock and fluid properties, as well as the Free Water Level (FWL), while ensuring consistency between measured and modeled data in a 3D reservoir model. This study employs the Bulk Volume Water (BVW) concept with the Bangestan and COSTA open-source carbonate datasets to develop a simple and practical SHF. A MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed to facilitate computations, including back-calculating capillary pressure (Pc) curves for comparison with input data and conducting error analysis. BVW is determined as the product of porosity and saturation at each Pc curve pressure step across a porosity range of 0.04 to 0.35. The relationship between BVW and pressure suggests that BVW is independent of porosity within the reservoir, allowing a single equation to represent all porosity variations. A power correlation with two constants was evaluated, and the correlation constants were derived from the BVW-pressure correlation. The results demonstrated strong agreement with the input data, and the generated capillary pressure curves closely matched the input Pc curves, confirming the reliability of the derived constants. An exponential correlation with four constants was tested on the same dataset, yielding a stronger correlation than the power function. The J-function was applied for comparison, but its predicted capillary pressure curves showed weaker correlation with the input data. Error analysis confirms that BVW-based SHFs offer a robust, permeability-independent alternative to the J-function, simplifying reservoir modeling by the need for rock type classification. The findings suggest that incorporating moderate- to high-porosity data improves the accuracy of estimated constants and enhances Pc curve synthesis."

    "title": "Surfactant-assisted catalytic aquathermolysis of heavy crude oil using CuO@TiO2 nanocomposite",
    "abstract": "Heavy crude oil is very challenging in the petroleum industry, owing to its complicated molecular composition and high viscosity, which make extraction, transportation, and refining difficult. Breaking through these challenges is essential to the efficiency of oil recovery and global energy demands. In this research, CuO@TiO₂ nanocomposites and surfactants in catalytic aquathermolysis are investigated as an efficient method for improving the flow properties and quality of heavy crude oil. Three nanocomposites of CuO@TiO₂ with varying CuO loadings (25%, 50%, and 75%) were synthesized and characterized using advanced techniques such as FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, XRD, BET, and TGA. The 50% CuO@TiO₂ nanocomposite possessed the optimum structural and catalytic properties, displaying a superior 72.4% reduction in viscosity of extra-heavy oil at 220 °C. Analytical techniques such as FT-IR, SARA analysis, and viscosity analysis attested to significant decreases in the resin (34.2%) and asphaltene (20.4%) contents, with increases in saturated (29.4%) and aromatic (36.04%) hydrocarbons. Catalytic process involved major reactions such as pyrolysis, hydrogenation, and desulfurization, targeting C–S, C–N, C–O, and C–C bonds. The synergistic effect of the CuO@TiO₂ nanocomposite and surfactants not only facilitated better oil mobility but also improved recovery efficiency, thus providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach to heavy oil upgrading. This study is an extension of our earlier study by demonstrating a new catalytic system based on the integration of nanocomposites with surfactants that achieves remarkable enhancement in reducing viscosity and oil quality. The results demonstrate the promise of this method for industrial implementation, allowing for the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly heavy oil recovery technologies.

    "title": "Optimizing demulsifier selection for crude oil dehydration: a fuzzy TOPSIS-based multi-criteria decision-making approach",
    "abstract": "The effective separation of water from crude oil is essential for maintaining oil quality, optimizing production efficiency, and minimizing operational challenges in the petroleum industry. However, selecting an optimal demulsifier remains a complex problem due to the need to balance separation efficiency, environmental impact, cost-effectiveness, and ease of application. This study addresses this challenge by applying the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) method, a robust multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, to evaluate and rank demulsifiers under uncertain conditions systematically. Four commercial demulsifiers, Alcopol 500, Polymer-based Demulsifier, Nalco Champion EC7135A, and Schlumberger’s ClearPhase, were assessed using fuzzy logic to quantify expert evaluations. The results indicate that Nalco Champion EC7135A achieved the highest closeness coefficient (0.751), making it the top-ranked demulsifier due to its superior separation efficiency and lower environmental impact. Alcopol 500 ranked second (0.708), followed by the Polymer-based Demulsifier (0.692) and Schlumberger’s ClearPhase (0.619). Compared to conventional selection approaches that often rely on trial-and-error or single-criterion assessments, this study demonstrates that Fuzzy TOPSIS provides a structured, quantitative, and transparent approach to demulsifier selection. The novelty of this research lies in its integration of fuzzy logic with MCDM for demulsifier evaluation, offering a more precise and adaptable framework for decision-making in oilfield operations. These findings have significant practical implications for the petroleum industry, as they enable more data-driven and sustainable selection processes, reducing operational costs and improving crude oil dehydration efficiency. Future research should focus on incorporating real-time operational data, expanding the evaluation to emerging eco-friendly demulsifiers, and integrating predictive machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of the selection process."

    "title": "A new shape factor for counter-current imbibition in anisotropic matrix blocks of fractured reservoirs",
    "abstract": "The shape factor is essential for characterizing matrix-fracture fluid transfer and scaling of spontaneous imbibition in fractured reservoirs. Most existing models assume isotropic permeability, while limited studies on anisotropic cases adopt constant shape factors that inadequately capture the transient behavior of counter-current imbibition. This study proposes a generalized time‑dependent shape factor for anisotropic matrix blocks. Two types of permeability tensors are considered: a diagonal permeability tensor aligned with matrix block boundaries, and a full permeability tensor representing general anisotropic configurations. Accordingly, anisotropic imbibition models were developed with approximate analytical solutions. Shape factors for 2D and 3D boundary conditions were determined using the scaling analysis method. Fine-grid simulations were conducted to extract imbibition recovery curves and validate the derived shape factor at the single-block scale. Field-scale dual-porosity simulations further demonstrate that the proposed model more accurately reproduces fine-grid results compared to conventional models. The results demonstrate that the shape factor is related to matrix block dimensions, boundary conditions, normalized recovery (or average water saturation), and permeability anisotropy. Crucially, the shape factor depends on both the magnitude and directions of principal permeabilities, significantly improving the accuracy of recovery predictions. This work enhances existing dual-porosity numerical models by integrating the proposed shape factor, enabling more reliable simulations of fluid exchange in anisotropic matrix blocks within fractured systems."

    "title": "Research on the characteristics of paleo-structural stress field and prediction of tectonic fractures in shale reservoirs of the Yichang Slope area in Western Hubei, China",
    "abstract": "The western Yichang area in Hubei Province serves as a key exploration target for shale gas in the Silurian Longmaxi Formation along the peripheral margin of the South China Basin. Since the Mesozoic, the Yichang Slope Zone has been subjected to multi-tectonic system controls, resulting in complex paleotectonic stress field distribution. The development patterns of structurally controlled fractures remain unclear, and favorable shale gas preservation zones influenced by tectonic fractures require further investigation-factors that significantly hinder shale gas development in this region.This study integrates seismic data, well logging data, laboratory analyses, and field outcrop observations with structural interpretation, finite element numerical simulation, and rock fracture criteria to analyze paleotectonic stress field characteristics. By reconstructing the distribution patterns of paleostress fields and predicting structural fracture development, we further delineate favorable zones for shale gas preservation and enrichment.Results demonstrate that the Yichang Slope Zone experienced two major tectonic events-the early and late Middle Yanshanian periods-with its primary structural framework established during the late Middle Yanshanian. The area predominantly develops conjugate shear fractures with SSE and NE orientations, formed under near E-W compressive stress fields generated by the Qinling-Dabie orogeny. The fracture coefficient of Longmaxi Formation shale ranges between 0.69 and 1.11, with values of 0.9–1.02 observed in the eastern study area, indicating a concealed fracture development stage that represents optimal conditions for shale gas preservation and accumulation.By combining field-observed fracture characteristics with numerical simulation results, this research successfully predicts structural fracture distribution patterns, providing critical geological guidance for shale gas exploration and development in the study area. Furthermore, the methodology offers valuable references for fracture prediction in other multi-phase tectonic deformation regions."

    "title": "Genesis of anhydrites in the dolomite facies of the oligo-miocene Asmari formation, Zagros basin: implication for reservoir quality",
    "abstract": "The type and amount of distribution of evaporite minerals within reservoir rocks play important role in reservoir quality. This study focuses on thin section petrography, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, aqueous fluid inclusions microthermometry, and UV fluorescence microscopy of hydrocarbon fluid inclusions, to study the genesis of anhydrites within dolomite facies of the Oligocene-Miocene Asmari Formation, Zagros Basin. Petrographic studies of primary (dolomicrite) and secondary (dolosparite) dolomite-dominated facies of the Asmari Formation showed that the associated diagenetic anhydrites occurred in different morphological textures (forms) including poikilotopic, pervasive pore-filling, scattered pore-filling, fracture-filling, and vein cements, nodular and layered forms. Fluid inclusion studies of anhydrites revealed that the diagenetic anhydrites particularly within the dolomicrite facies were formed at an average temperature of 68.2 °C, and by mineralizing solutions with salinity of about 23.5 wt% NaCl. Indeed, in the dolomicrite facies, the anhydrites were associated with gypsum dewatering and/or direct anhydrite precipitation during eodiagenesis. In contrast, in the dolosparite facies, anhydrites were formed at an average temperature of 100.1 °C, and by mineralizing solutions with salinity of about 16.4 wt% NaCl. This latter condition was very likely related to the dolomitization processes including the creation of calcium-rich and magnesium-poor pore fluids with presence of sufficient sulfate ions during the mesodiagenesis. Occurrences of eugenic and mesogenic anhydrites within the dolomite facies were largely controlled the petrophysical parameters as well as the reservoir quality of the Asmari Formation."

    "title": "Study on helical post-buckling of motional coiled tubing in horizontal wells",
    "abstract": "Coiled tubing is widely used in oil and gas operations. However, the long coiled tubing may undergo sinusoidal or helical buckling deformations, and even lock-up, leading to property damage and serious accidents. To study boundary conditions effects on helical post-buckling of coiled tubing in horizontal wellbores, firstly, the mathematical model containing dynamic terms for nonlinear buckling deformation of coiled tubing in horizontal wells is established in this paper. Secondly, using the improved perturbation method, the third-order perturbation solution of the relationship between pitch and time during helical post-buckling of coiled tubing in horizontal wells is obtained, and the expression of the contact force between coiled tubing and wellbore wall with the time terms is derived. Finally, the effects of gravity, the change velocity of the pitch, and the axial load on the contact force are analyzed separately. The results show that when considering the effect of gravity, the axial internal stress in each micro-element segment of coiled tubing undergoing helical post-buckling exhibits periodic variation. The greater the compression velocity, the greater the contact force between coiled tubing and the wellbore wall. The discriminative conditions for the occurrence of lock-up in coiled tubing undergoing helical post-buckling are proposed, and increasing the axial load can delay the occurrence of lock-up. The mathematical model established in this paper innovatively incorporates time-dependent dynamics, and breaking through the limitations of the traditional quasi-static assumptions of buckling analysis. This model provides a new method and theoretical basis for further study of coiled tubing helical post-buckling process."

    "title": "Accurate estimation of permeability reduction resulted from low salinity water flooding in clay-rich sandstones",
    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of permeability reduction in clay-rich sandstones during low-salinity water flooding is critical for optimizing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies and ensuring efficient reservoir management. Traditional methods often rely on costly experiments or simplified empirical correlations, which struggle to capture the complex, non-linear interactions governing this phenomenon. This study introduces a novel data-driven approach utilizing a comprehensive suite of machine learning (ML) methods—including random forest, decision tree, adaptive boosting, ensemble learning, K-nearest neighbors, multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and support vector machines—to provide robust predictions of permeability reduction. Methodology of current work, applied to 300 meticulously curated experimental observations, involved rigorous data preprocessing (outlier detection, integrity verification) and k-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability. The results show that random forest and ensemble learning algorithms delivered the highest predictive accuracy, evidenced by the most substantial coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and minimal error metrics. A sensitivity analysis further clarified that while increasing flooding water salinity and ionic strength leads to a reduction in permeability drop, both the flow rate and the sandstone's clay content exhibit a positive correlation with permeability impairment. This work provides a comprehensive, validated, and highly accurate ML framework specifically tailored for predicting complex permeability alterations, offering a superior alternative to conventional approaches and enhancing decision-making in EOR projects."

    "abstract": "Sand production in weakly consolidated sandstone reservoirs presents a significant challenge for hydrocarbon recovery, affecting both the reservoir stability and productivity. This study introduces a novel chemical sand consolidation formulation comprising polyacrylamide, chromium(III) acetate, and nano-silica, aimed at enhancing sand control while minimizing permeability reduction. The stability, rheological properties, and compressive strength of the formulation were experimentally evaluated at reservoir-relevant temperatures (25–80 °C) using bottle tests, rheometry, and unconfined compressive-strength measurements. The optimal formulation, containing 9500 ppm polyacrylamide, 2612.5 ppm chromium(III) acetate, and 6500 ppm nano-silica, achieved a compressive strength exceeding 3552.23 kPa, surpassing the typical requirements for weak sandstones. Core flooding experiments indicated a permeability reduction, which was attributed to modifications in the post-gelation pore structure rather than extensive pore blockage. Although the formulation effectively consolidates the formation, minimizing the impact on permeability is crucial for maximizing hydrocarbon recovery. Future research should focus on refining the formulation and injection strategies to further mitigate permeability reduction and optimize the balance between sand control and permeability retention. This innovative approach, incorporating nanoparticles and a lower concentration of the less toxic chromium(III) acetate, offers a promising alternative to conventional sand consolidation methods, with the potential for improved environmental compatibility."

    "title": "Application of log-based specific surface area prediction for permeability modeling in a highly heterogeneous carbonate reservoir in the middle east",
    "abstract": "In contrast to the well-studied North Sea chalks, the effectiveness of log-based specific surface area modeling techniques for heterogeneous Iranian (Middle Eastern) carbonates is underexplored. This study evaluates two log-based methodologies for specific surface modeling and their role in predicting permeability. The first method utilizes density and gamma-ray logs, as previously validated in North Sea chalks, while the second method innovatively integrates deep resistivity and porosity data using a K-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm. Results are compared with core data, including porosity, permeability, facies identified through thin-section petrography, mineralogy via X-ray diffraction, mercury injection porosimetry, and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. The research focuses on the Asmari (Oligo-Miocene) and Jahrum (Mid-Eocene) formations. Petrographic analysis exhibits processes like dissolution, dolomitization, and anhydrite cementation that have significantly altered the Asmari Formation's fabric, leading to substantial pore structure heterogeneity. In contrast, the Jahrum Formation has retained its biogenic traits but has been modified by calcite and celestine cementation. Notably, the identification of celestine in the Jahrum Formation is a new finding that merits further exploration in the Zagros region. The density and gamma-ray log derived specific surface shows a negative trend with porosity and predicts a low permeability for low porosity. This low permeability probably represents matrix properties. Core samples of low porosity have much higher permeability, probably due to fracturing. If a subset of core data are used in a machine-learning approach together with data on deep resistivity, a high correlation coefficient (CC = 0.8) between modelled and calculated specific surface is obtained. Two trends were observed: a negative correlation for porosities above 0.05 and a positive correlation for lower porosities, likely influenced by fractures. Provided the fractures in the core samples truly represent fractures in the reservoir, permeability modeled using log-based specific surface tends to underestimate permeability, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.62 for the first method and an improved results (CC = 0.7) from the machine-learning approach."

The study aims to improve ROP prediction accuracy and computational efficiency while addressing the challenges of real-time implementation in dynamic drilling environments.

Metaheuristic algorithms optimize the ELM’s weights and biases to improve predictive performance. The models were trained and validated using a dataset of 13,262 data points from an Algerian field, with different statistical metrics used for evaluation.

    "abstract": "Predictive maintenance of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) is critical for minimizing unplanned shutdowns and improving the reliability of oil production systems. This study explores the application of ensemble machine learning algorithms to predict the operational status of ESPs using real-world SCADA sensor data from a field containing seven active wells. A single well, selected based on its comprehensive anomaly logs and documented failure history, was analyzed over a 105-day period. During this interval, approximately 87,000 multivariate sensor data points were collected, offering a rich dataset for modeling degradation patterns and predictive maintenance. A trend-based, domain-informed labeling strategy was implemented to classify ESP behavior into three operational states: stable, unstable, and failure. Key preprocessing steps included outlier removal using Isolation Forest and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The processed data were then used to train and evaluate two ensemble classifiers CatBoost and ExtraTrees alongside baseline models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). Among the models tested, CatBoost achieved the highest classification performance with an overall accuracy of 94.2%, and a recall of 96.5% for the failure class, outperforming other models particularly in handling imbalanced data. The model demonstrated strong generalization under cross-validation and robustness to noise and outliers. The novelty of this work lies in integrating rule-based labeling, PCA, and ensemble methods into a unified, interpretable, and scalable predictive framework suitable for field-wide ESP monitoring. Compared to existing approaches, this method improves early failure detection and reduces false alarms, making it more practical for real-time deployment in oilfield SCADA environments."

    "title": "Spectral decomposition-based static reservoir simulations image Cretaceous hydrocarbon-bearing incised-valley, Southwest Pakistan",
    "abstract": "Incised valley sandfills are globally renowned for forming excellent stratigraphic traps. These incised valleys are developed during the extensively falling stage of the sea, followed by a negligible rise, which fills the incised valleys with coarse-grained reservoir facies. However, sea-level fluctuations cause fluctuations in the lateral distribution of the reservoir. Hence, it becomes very difficult to simulate the exact thickness, impedances, and lateral phase changes. Hence, these might act as direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHI). Therefore, this study applies the state-of-the-art spectral decomposition and static acoustic impedance reservoir simulations tool to determine the thin-bedded reservoirs within a stratigraphically complex unit for implicating the future well drilling strategies for the known gas field of Indus Onshore, Pakistan. The key emphasis was given to the selection and optimizations of the spectral waveform-based simulations. The outcomes of these simulations were to develop strategies for horizontal well drillings. The stratigraphic traps are NNW-SSE oriented with localized transpressional fault-controlled components. These fault-controlled components have played a vital role in the upward migration of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir facies. The 21-Hz, 29-Hz, and 41-Hz tuning blocks outline the hydrocarbon-bearing sand-filled reservoir facies inside the Lowstands system tract (LST). The 57-Hz tuning block recognizes the transgressive seal facies at the top of the LST. The bandlimited static reservoir model (SRM) shows some noise events within the sedimentary reflections. The 21-Hz spectral wavelet-based developed SRM has enhanced the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for imaging a 34 m thick sand-filled lens. Consequently, this study serves as an analog for global shallow-marine incised valley systems."

    "title": "Interaction of the naphthalene-induced catalysis and leaching of magnetite: insights on acid fracturing for oil and gas recovery efficiency",
    "abstract": "Acid fracturing is a widely used technique to enhance oil recovery in carbonate reservoirs, but its effectiveness depends on several factors, including the presence of iron oxides. Magnetite, commonly found in sedimentary rocks – including carbonates that comprise over 50% of global petroleum systems – can significantly influence catalytic activity, mineral leaching, and dissolution during acid–rock interactions. This study investigates the surface properties and catalytic behavior of magnetite particles ranging from nano - to micrometric sizes under acid injection conditions. Two catalysts were evaluated: (i) homogeneous FeSO₄ and (ii) heterogeneous Fe₃O₄ with variable grain sizes, both characterized through a suite of physicochemical analyses (Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopes, X-Ray Diffraction, Rietveld refinement and N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, for surface area and porous nature). Leaching experiments were performed using synthetic seawater at pH 2.36 and 8.40, focusing on the degradation of naphthalene – a representative hydrocarbon in oil reservoirs – and of H 2 O 2 . Results demonstrate that while the homogeneous catalyst achieved the highest efficiency in naphthalene degradation, heterogeneous magnetite also catalyzed significant substrate degradation – particularly the nanometric Magtt S, which showed enhanced activity due to greater surface area and iron leaching. Magnetite clustering links specific surface area to cationic site availability, both crucial for catalytic performance. The acid-induced release of Fe²⁺ further enhanced the generation of hydroxyl radicals, promoting more efficient hydrocarbon degradation. These findings highlight that the presence of magnetite in carbonate reservoirs undergoing acid fracturing can promote unintended hydrocarbon decomposition, alter reservoir geochemistry, and compromise mechanical stability through oxide dissolution and porosity changes."

    "abstract": "The benthic foraminifera are widely used to study marginal coastal environments and assess environmental changes as well as the consequences of pollution. The present study aims to investigate benthic foraminiferal associations in sediments polluted by anthropic activities that increase heavy metal contamination along the northern coast of Sfax City in Tunisia. This work is based on the study of two cores, SC1 (80 cm) and SC2 (70 cm). A granulometric analysis of the sediments was conducted using the sieving method. The foraminifera associations were the subject of a micropaleontological study. Bibliographic data regarding the distribution of heavy metals in the study area are also considered. The foraminiferal density and diversity are high within the unimpacted interval in the lower units of the cores. However, the heavy metal affected intervals in the middle and especially in the upper units, show a decrease in density and diversity of benthic foraminifera, as well as the presence of deformed tests, especially in Ammonia tepida , Peneroplis planatus , Sorites variabilis , and Miliolids. This study also shows that foraminiferal associations in unimpacted environments affected by heavy metals are dominated by species characteristic of shallow water with sandy sedimentary environments, such as Ammonia parkinsoniana , Elphidium ( E. advanum , E. crispum , and E. macellum ), Peneroplis planatus , Sorites variabilis , and Miliolids. In contrast, opportunistic species such as Ammonia tepida and Haynesina germanica dominate foraminiferal associations in impacted environments."

    "title": "Lower Cretaceous to Eocene calciturbidites and calcidebrites of the Ionian Zone, western Greece: insights into the factors controlling deposition",
    "abstract": "Submarine gravity flows on carbonate platform slopes lead to the deposition of calciturbidites and calcidebrites in adjacent deep-water basins. Under certain conditions, morphological highs can serve as sediment sources and influence sediment distribution. This study aimed to identify such gravity flow deposits within Lower Cretaceous–Eocene carbonate sequences in the Ionian Zone of western Greece and assess the factors affecting their deposition. Detailed lithostratigraphic analysis was performed in the Plataria and Elataria areas in the Epirus region, revealing intercalated mudstone facies with thick carbonate layers of packstones, grainstones, and floatstones. Textural analysis of thin sections from Elataria indicates debris flow deposition, marked by skeletal fragments and chert clasts in a calcareous matrix. Graded beds transitioning into planar and ripple cross-laminations suggest that debris flows evolved into turbidity currents. Facies distribution varied, with debritic facies commonly found near diapiric salt exposures, while turbiditic facies dominated in distal settings. During the Lower to Upper Cretaceous, paleo-topographic highs, amplified by salt uprise, provided clastic material for calciturbiditic deposits. In the Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene, increased sediment influx from carbonate platforms led to thick gravity flow successions. These deposits indicate a carbonate slope apron setting, with a decline in gravity flows by the Eocene, marking a shift from carbonate to clastic sedimentation. Regarding the reservoir types, diagenetic processes observed in the identified gravity flow intervals have significantly overprinted primary porosity in the calciturbiditic and calcidebritic layers, which are primarily considered fractured reservoirs."

    "title": "Basin evolution in the Gulf of Çandarlı through seismic mapping, Aegean Sea, offshore Türkiye",
    "abstract": "Early Miocene lacustrine deposits possessing source rock and reservoir properties are characterised by seismic mapping in the Foça-Çandarlı Basin of the Turkish sector of the Aegean Sea. A similar petroleum system has also been recognised in the adjacent onshore Gediz and Bakırçay grabens. In this study, 800 km of seismic data acquired in 1975 and 1985 have been interpreted. Miocene and Pliocene horizons were mapped, and possible hydrocarbon traps were identified. In this context, the tectonic evolution of the Foça-Çandarlı Basin has been determined. The Foça-Çandarlı Basin opened under NE and SE extension during the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene. The tectonic regime shifted to a transpressional state due to the westward tectonic escape of Anatolia during its collision with the Aegean Block. As a consequence of this tectonic reversal, we observe a clockwise rotation in the compressional deformation along the southern margin of the basin. In contrast, the change may have involved a counterclockwise rotation in the north since the end of the Early Miocene. Faults at the basin boundaries were inverted, and the basin began to close from the west during the Mid-Late Miocene and Pliocene. The seismic mapping accurately demonstrates all these changes."

    "title": "Glacial chronology and climate implications since the Penultimate Glacial Cycle in the Upper Garonne Basin, Central Pyrenees",
    "abstract": "The Pyrenean Range was intensively shaped by glaciers during the Late Pleistocene glacial cycles. The chronology of past glacial oscillations has been increasingly unveiled during the last decade, although comprehensive reviews of glacial evolution during the Late Pleistocene are still missing. Here, we review the glacial and periglacial chronology existing in the Upper Garonne Basin, which is organized in three moraine complexes at (i) the Loures-Barousse-Barbazan Basin (LBBB), (ii) valleys, and (iii) glacial cirques. The most external moraine preserved at 420–480 m asl in the LBBB unveiled the Maximum Ice Extent from the Penultimate Glacial Cycle during the MIS-6, as indicated by Cosmic-Ray Exposure ages of ca. 130 ka. During the Last Glacial Cycle, the Garonne paleoglacier reached the LBBB once again before 40 and 32 cal ka BP, marking the local Last Glacial Maximum in the Pyrenees. However, by the time of the global Last Glacial Maximum, the slopes of the Marignac Basin were already deglaciated, as evidenced by two polished surfaces dated to 21–24 ka at elevations of 520–540 m asl. Thereafter, glaciers shrank upvalleys during the last deglaciation, as shown by polished surfaces at 1860–1900 m asl in the Ruda Valley dated to 14–15 ka. The glacial retreat within the valleys was interrupted by two glacial advances or standstills during the second half of the Bølling–Allerød Interstadial, around 13.5 and 13.0 ka. During the Younger Dryas, glaciers advanced to elevations of 2370–2470 m asl within the glacial hollows, where moraines stabilized at 12.9 and 12.6 ka. Following this advance, paraglacial processes intensified, transforming the final debris-free glaciers into debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers. The warming at the onset of the Holocene prompted the final stabilization of boulders around 11.9 ka in the relic rock glacier of Lòcampo Cirque and 7.2 ka in the debris-covered glacier of Bacivèr Cirque. This synthesis highlights the potential of the Upper Garonne Basin to serve as a key reference area for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of glacial and periglacial dynamics in the Pyrenees throughout the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene."

    "abstract": "Detailed field mapping along with sedimentological descriptions has been used to characterise the Umba deposit in the Tanga Basin, in northern Tanzania, providing a better understanding of characteristic facies, facies associations, and depositional environments. Facies, facies associations and the depositional environments through which these deposits were laid down have been poorly understood. Fifteen sedimentary facies and seven facies associations (FA1-FA7) have been identified. They include thick, poorly bedded diamictite (FA1); thick, massive, homogeneous diamictite (FA2); dropstone-bearing, lenticular, ripped to laminated sandstone (FA3); lenticular to sub-horizontal sandstone (FA4); horizontally stratified wavy sandstone (FA5); tabular beds of sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone (FA6) and carbonate deposit (FA7). Based on the sedimentological features and regional correlation to the Ruhuhu basin of Tanzania and the Dwyka Group of the South African Karoo Basin, the identified sediments are interpreted to have been deposited mainly in low relief and extensive peneplain glaciofluvial-lacustrine settings with subordinate subglacial till (FA1 and FA2), proglacial braided river channels (FA3), and delta front environments. The delta front environment is characterised by a distributary channel (FA4), a subaqueous levee (FA5), a distal bar (FA6), and an overbank deposit (FA7). This study provides new insights into the deposition of the Lower Karoo-equivalent rocks, both at the local and regional levels."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the platform margin of the Kaijiang-Liangping Trough in northeastern Sichuan Basin has become a key exploration target for the Feixianguan Formation oolitic shoal gas reservoirs. Previous studies of carbonate reservoirs predominantly utilized conventional analytical methods (e.g., wireline log interpretation and thin-section petrography), which have demonstrated limited efficacy in characterizing the inherent complexity of carbonate reservoirs. This is especially lacking precise lithological information and detailed knowledge of microscale properties, which are crucial for effective carbonate reservoirs evaluation. To enhance the understanding of the characteristics and controlling factors of carbonate shoal reservoirs in the study area, a new method for characterizing carbonate shoal reservoirs was established using conventional microscopic thin sections observation, physical property analysis of porosity and permeability, combined with advanced carbon and oxygen isotopes and scanning electron microscope. Firstly, the analysis of dolomitization environments through carbon and oxygen isotope geochemistry (δ¹³C/δ¹⁸O) provides fundamental constraints for studying the characteristics and controlling factors of carbonate reservoirs. Secondly, using thin sections and scanning electron microscopy to identify the characteristics of different carbonate reservoir spaces, and then determining the type of carbonate reservoir based on physical properties and diagenetic characteristics. Finally, by combining fluctuations of sea-level, tectonic and diagenetic processes, a comprehensive evaluation of carbonate reservoirs is conducted to clarify the characteristics and controlling factors of carbonate shoal facies reservoirs. Based on these studies, the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation oolitic dolomite shoal facies along the platform margin should be prioritized as the primary exploration target in the Kaijiang-Liangping Trough. This innovative methodology, integrating both micro- and macro-scale analyses with qualitative and quantitative approaches, demonstrates significant potential for advancing carbonate reservoir exploration and development practices."

    "abstract": "The calcareous tufas in this study occur in a large fan-shaped body at the terminus of the Oued (River) Bourkaïz, fed by the karstic Ain (Spring) Bourkaïz, in the arid Saïs Basin, near Fez, Morocco. These Mid-to-Upper Holocene tufas occur as nine facies distributed across three morpho-sedimentary units: barrages (dams, back-barrage pools, and distal-fan deposits. The facies include oncolitic, phytoclastic, stromatolitic, moss, phytohermal-stem, bioclastic gastropodal, melanized, microbial limestone, and sand tufa facies. SEM analysis indicates the relevant role of megaphytes, cyanobacteria, and algae in the calcite precipitation of these tufa facies. Carbon-isotope signatures suggest interaction with organic matter and CO 2 of biogenic origin, while oxygen-isotope signatures revealed various amounts of evaporation depending on the nature of the facies. Moreover, radiocarbon dating of the lowermost back barrage tufas (6.7–5.6 cal. ka BP) suggests initial tufa formation during the wet, humid, Mid-Holocene African Humid Period, while the uppermost, back-barrage tufas show dates that range between 2.2 and 2.1 cal ka BP, dates that approximately coinciding with the Roman-Iberian Climate Optimum."

    "title": "Middle–upper eocene sediments and sea-level dynamics in central Tunisia",
    "abstract": "Magnetic susceptibility (MS) and clay mineralogy data from the Bougobrine and Souar sections (middle–upper eocene) in Central Tunisia were analyzed in conjunction with existing sedimentological data to better understand the dynamics of the late eocene climate and sea-level changes. The results suggest increased activity of primary sediment sources during the late eocene, leading to significant shifts in magnetic signals and clay mineralogy. These changes began at the Uppermost Bartonian in the proximal Bougobrine section and at the base of the Priabonian in the distal Souar section. The variations in hematite, goethite, and magnetite concentrations account for MS fluctuations in the homogeneous distal shales of the Souar section. In contrast, the shallower carbonate-rich Bougobrine section shows less cyclicity, which could be linked to diagenesis, carbonate dilution, or a lack of magnetic minerals. We propose distinct sediment source regions for the Lutetian–Bartonian deposits, with contributions from the northern, eastern, and southwestern provinces. In the Priabonian, however, the increased dominance of silt and later sand (near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary) reflects a shift primarily to western and southwestern sources, with a minor contribution from the north."

    "title": "A novel application of deep learning and thermal image segmentation to detect loosening rocks in the Draa Sfar deep underground mine in Morocco",
    "abstract": "Identifying rock mass instabilities is crucial in geotechnical monitoring, particularly in underground structures such as deep underground mines. Conventional techniques for identifying unstable rock blocks rely on visual and acoustic assessments, which lack automation and objectivity. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for sophisticated monitoring techniques that fulfill the precision and effectiveness standards for underground geotechnical assessment. This study will employ deep learning-based computer vision models to propose an intelligent approach for detecting and segmenting unstable rock blocks in underground mines. It utilizes three variants of the U-shaped convolutional neural network, referred to as U-Net: Base-U-Net, Attention U-Net, and BCDU-Net (Backbone Convolutional Deconvolution U-Net), to identify and segregate unstable rock blocks in thermal images. A detailed dataset of 1502 annotated images was assembled from a video recorded at the Draa Sfar deep underground mine in Morocco using a FLIR A70 Research & Development thermal camera for model training, validation, and testing. In this work, the Base-U-Net model achieved high training and validation accuracies, as well as an average performance during the testing phase. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the U-Net model in segmenting unstable rock blocks in thermal images, particularly as a first attempt to apply this model in the field of mining geotechnics. Our research highlights the use of deep learning-based computer vision models to enhance geotechnical engineering applications and safety protocols in mining structures."

    "title": "Holocene glacier evolution in the Pyrenees based on 36Cl cosmic-ray exposure dating (Troumouse Cirque, Pyrenees National Park)",
    "abstract": "While the Late Glacial evolution of Pyrenean glaciers is rather well-known, Holocene glacier behavior is much less constrained, except for the Little Ice Age period. In this study, we attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by dating four moraines in the Western-Central Pyrenees using in situ chlorine-36 cosmic-ray exposure dating of moraine boulders. Ages of 11.2 ± 1.5 ka, 7.8 ± 1.1 ka, 3.0 ± 0.6 ka and 972 ± 208 yr were obtained, constituting the most robust directly dated Holocene glacier chronology in the Pyrenees. The moraine age of 7.8 ± 1.1 ka ( n = 5) is a novel finding as no evidence for significant contemporary glacial advance exists at any other site in the Pyrenees or in the Alps/elsewhere in Europe. We tentatively link this moraine to the 8.2 ka cold event. We propose a paleoclimatic interpretation of this Holocene glacial evolution, in conjunction with the radiocarbon ages from nearby peat bog cores. Further, we hypothesize on the role of Mid-Holocene warm periods on the melting of permafrost within rock glacier complexes and how they translate into peat bog deposits in the vicinity of the moraines. Finally, based on archeological evidence (construction and ceramic remains) collected in the center of Troumouse Cirque, the possible influence of its glacier variability on first human settlements in the region is discussed."

    "title": "Tectonic control of the Late Cretaceous sedimentation in north-central Tunisia: Insights from unconformities and early basin inversion",
    "abstract": "The geodynamic evolution of the southern Tethyan margin results from major tectonic events of the Neo-Tethys Ocean. These tectonic events are caused by the complex interaction between the African and Eurasian plates. The transition from a dominant Early Mesozoic extension/transtension to a compression/transpression tectonic regime since the Late Cretaceous has resulted in inverted edifices, forming intracontinental mountain belts. Tunisia is located at the southern margin of the Neo-Tethys, a critical region in which to investigate the tectonic influence on sedimentation. This region is significant because it marks the location of the final rifting stages of the Neo-Tethys and the early onset of the closure of this margin. In north-central Tunisia, five cross-sections covering the Cenomanian-Maastrichtian interval have been described and sampled in Jebel Bargou and Jebel Serj outcrops. This study investigated field data, high-resolution biostratigraphy, and lithostratigraphic correlations of strata, which allowed constraining of the timing of unconformities and the history of the subsidence inversion of the basin. Three major unconformities during the Late Cretaceous deposition are identified in this study. These unconformities, located in the SW of Jebel Bargou, span from the Coniacian to Maastrichtian period and are marked by Paleocene marls ( Globorotalia trinidadensis biozone) that unconformably overlie the Late Coniacian series ( Dicarinella concavata biozone). A basin inversion is identified in the study area. This process started during the Turonian and continued through the Campanian–Maastrichtian, highlighting a high domain in the Jebel Bargou and a subsiding domain in the SW of Jebel Serj. Similar tectonic inversion events have already been identified in other areas of Tunisia and the surrounding regional context within the northern and southern Tethyan margin during the Late Cretaceous. This inversion could be explained by a Santonian compressional event that probably started earlier in the context of the tectonic evolution of the Neo-Tethys Ocean and the convergence between the African and European plates. The tectonic evolution of the Neo-Tethys Ocean is the result of multi-oceanic basin expansion, bidirectional subduction, and microplate collisions dominating the Mediterranean region, northward oceanic subduction, and diachronous continental collision across the Middle East."

    "abstract": "Anatolia is usually accepted as the landbridge for hominin dispersal from Africa, Asia, to Europe. However, there are few hominin findings in Anatolia and even fewer palynological analyses of hominin sites. This paper presents a palynological study of the Lower Palaeolithic Dursunlu hominin site in Central Anatolia (Turkey) to reconstruct palaeovegetation and palaeoenvironmental conditions. Palynological samples were collected from a lignite quarry in which the lithic assemblage-bearing layer (LAL) was dated as Late–Early Biharian (Late–Early Pleistocene) based on rich mammal remains. The dominance of freshwater algae ( Sigmopollis, Ovoidites, Spirogyra, Pediastrum, Botryococcus ) and herbs (Asteraceae-Asteroideae, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae) within the LAL in association with the consistent presence of hydrophytes (Cyperaceae , Typha, Sparganium, Ludwigia ) and ferns (Polypodiaceae) indicates the presence of a freshwater marsh. Most of the identified algae prefer mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions and are characteristic of stagnant shallow water. The mutual dominance of herbs and ferns reflects changes in humidity. The few pollen grains of Pinus suggest distant pollen transport from the surrounding highlands. The results of the palynological analysis revealed that ca. 0.9 Ma, the freshwater marsh at the Dursunlu site, provided a landscape rich in resources with freshwater for hominins."

    "title": "Unravelling the tectonostratigraphy and kinematics of the Late Cretaceous-Eocene deformations in the Eastern Central Taurides (Türkiye)",
    "abstract": "The rocks of the Bozkır, Bolkardağı, and Aladağ units, exposed in the eastern part of the Central Taurides in southern Türkiye, result from a series of geological processes from subduction to hard collision, following their formation in the Inner Tauride Ocean. The Bozkır Unit is composed of ophiolites, a metamorphic sole, and mélanges. The Bolkardağı Unit comprises metamorphic rocks, while the Aladağ Unit predominantly consists of limestone and dolomite in the study area. The structural evolution of the Taurides remains poorly understood due to a lack of analytical data. This study integrates the facies characteristics of the Tauride units with their kinematic data to draw conclusions about their structural evolution and evaluate the direction of palaeostresses causing deformation. In addition to conventional field studies, structural data, including planar and linear deformation structures, were measured from all individual units and analysed using stereographic projections. The folds of the Bolkardağı and Aladağ units, exhibiting a NW vergence around a NE-SW direction fold axial plane inclined to the SE direction, have been subjected to deformation under the influence of compression from southeast to northwest. The majority of the faults are classified as reverse faults, exhibiting a NE-SW striking, dipping towards the SE. The analysis indicates that the predominant palaeostress was oriented from southeast to northwest, as evidenced by the stress slickenlines in the hanging wall of the fault planes. The emplacement of the tectonostratigraphic units and their subsequent post-emplacement deformations indicate that compressional deformation occurred in two distinct directions during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene period. We interpret the SE-directed emplacement of Tauride units during the Turonian to Middle Eocene as a result of thrust tectonics. Conversely, the NW-directed backthrusting that occurred during the Middle-Late Eocene is associated with the tightening of the suture zone of the Inner Tauride Ocean."

    "title": "Hydraulic conductivity measurement by Porchet test: implications for the evaluation of artificial recharge thresholds of the Tinejdad–Touroug aquifer (Southeast Morocco)",
    "abstract": "Southeastern Morocco is experiencing a water scarcity crisis due to groundwater overexploitation, combined with the effects of climate change, agriculture, industry, and consumer demand. To mitigate water scarcity, artificial recharge techniques have been applied to the quaternary aquifer in the Tinejdad–Touroug region. These include building recharge thresholds that induce infiltration into Wadi beds by working dead ends and reducing flow rates downstream of the limits. Thirty experiments to evaluate hydraulic conductivity using the Porchet technique were conducted around the existing thresholds, at the locations of the other thresholds programmed, and at the oasis soils. As determined by infiltration tests, infiltration varies from 0.12 to 2.59 cm/day for oasis soils, while it ranges from 0.10 to 2.91 cm/day for areas not silted near the thresholds. The hydraulic conductivities in the centers of existing thresholds range from 10 –4 to 10 –5 m/s, with sandy silt constituting most of this type of soil. The hydraulic conductivities of silted zones range from 10 –5 to 10 –7 m/s. The low readings at these sites indicate the presence of a composition of silts, clays, and extremely fine sands. The upstream part of Tanguerfa Wadi is anticipated to receive higher clay content, with values reaching a maximum of 8.63.10 –7 m/s. The study demonstrated the efficiency of these recharge techniques in increasing groundwater recharge. However, the thresholds showed a slight decline in performance due to sludge accumulation. Recharge measurements after heavy rainfall indicate notable increases in groundwater levels. Data from 2019, 2021, and 2023 show varying aquifer recharge rates, averaging 18.62 mm/day in 2019, 8.89 mm/day in 2021, and 29.67 mm/day in 2023."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the hydrocarbon potential of the Sapphire Field using pyrolysis data from 55 shale samples. Total organic carbon (TOC) ranges from 0.58 to 1.35 wt.%, indicating variable generative potential. Kerogen analysis reveals a mixture of Type II (oil- and gas-prone) and Type III (gas-prone) organic matter, with Type III dominating in the studied samples, indicating primarily thermogenic gas potential with limited oil-generating capacity. Burial history analysis reveals high subsidence rates in the Bilqas (1302.06 m/Ma) and Kafr El-Sheikh (1480.84 m/Ma) formations, while other formations (El-Wastani, Abu Madi, Qawasim, Sidi Salem, Qantara) exhibit lower rates (198.68–543.25 m/Ma). The Kafr El-Sheikh Formation is the primary source rock, entering the early oil window (~ 0.55–0.7% VRo) at 4.48 Ma (636 m) and progressing to the wet gas window (~ 1.3–2.0% VRo) by 3.18 Ma (1454 m), persisting today (EASY% VRo model). The Qantara and El-Wastani formations serve as the key reservoirs, while the Bilqas/Mit Ghamr formations act as seals. This analysis clarifies the Sapphire Field’s petroleum system, detailing source rock quality, thermal maturity, and trap formation mechanisms. The Kafr El-Sheikh Formation’s high subsidence and maturation underscore its significance as a major hydrocarbon source/reservoir in the West Delta Deep Marine."

    "abstract": "Evaluating hydrological trends is crucial for the sustainable management of water resources with the escalating impacts of climate change. This study assesses the Wadi Bouhamdane Basin in Northeast Algeria, integrating data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) with hydrological observations and modeling to provide insights into precipitation and runoff dynamics since 1991. Using techniques such as linear regression, the Mann–Kendall trend test, cumulative departure, mutation analysis, and Morlet wavelet transformations, we identified a declining trend in annual rainfall (− 36.85 mm/decade) and an increase in runoff (20.65 mm/decade). Our rainfall analysis projected droughts from 2018 to 2020 and a water-rich phase in 2024, with predicted fluctuations extending into 2025. GRACE/GFO data from 2002 to 2022 revealed consistent reductions in terrestrial water storage (~ 0.35 cm/year), marked declines during projected drought periods, and insights into post-drought recovery and water accumulation trends. These findings are consistent with the projected wet–dry fluctuations from 2021 to 2023 and suggest the onset of a wetter period around 2024. The runoff sequence is projected to maintain its slight upward trend from 2018 to 2019, with fluctuations from 2018 to 2020, a dry period from 2022 to 2024, and a predicted dry year in 2025. Our combined approach of satellite data with ground-based measurements highlights the complex interactions influencing hydrological responses in semi-arid regions. This study underscores the significance of merging conventional hydrological methods with advanced satellite observations to enhance water management precision and resilience, advocating for a multi-source data framework to inform sustainable water resource policies amid evolving climate conditions."

    "abstract": "The ancient metropolis of Pergamon in Asia Minor underwent profound transformations from the Hellenistic to the Roman Imperial period, affecting the peri-urban surroundings. This study aims to identify phases of landscape development in the Araplı alluvial fan and its peri-urbanized catchment. We examined seven sediment cores from the Araplı alluvial fan at the fringe of the Kozak horst and the Bakırçay graben using macroscopic and geochemical sediment analyses and radiocarbon dating. Our results show that the Araplı area was characterized by a floodplain with seasonal water bodies in the Early Holocene. Following a general climatic trend towards lower precipitation and the onset of human activities in the region during the Early Bronze Age, the deposition of overbank fines indicates dominant aggradation of the Bakırçay alluvial plain. Intensified human activities in the peri-urban surroundings of Pergamon during the Roman Imperial period likely increased soil erosion, triggering the burial of the Bakırçay alluvial plain by the prograding Araplı alluvial fan. This change in sediment dynamics is more pronounced in the Araplı area than in other rural areas in the Pergamon micro-region studied to date. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the local variability of sediment dynamics in a micro-region undergoing profound transformations during antiquity, where, as today, peri-urban areas were focal points of land degradation."

    "title": "Shear-related gold mineralization in the Egyptian Nubian Shield, East African orogenic belt",
    "abstract": "The Egyptian Nubian Shield (ENS) represents the northeastern extension of the East African Orogenic Belt. The East African Orogeny (EAO) emerged as a result of the closure of the Mozambique Ocean, which served as a demarcation line between the East and West Gondwana continental masses. This tectonic phenomenon led to the consolidation of various juvenile arc and back-arc igneous and sedimentary rock formations, dating from approximately 870 to 625 Ma. The resulting terrane sutures are often characterized by mafic–ultramafic ophiolitic assemblages and remnants. The ENS exhibits three predominant structural domains: the southern compressional domain (SCD), the central transpressional domain (CTD), and the northern extensional domain (NED). The central transpressional domain contains the most significant gold mines and occurrences in the ENS. Gold extraction in Egypt has a long history, facilitated by the Egyptian Geologic Survey and Mining Authorities. The formation of orogenic gold in the Eastern Desert is attributed to the processes following the accretion of arc terranes in the ENS, a period marked by significant geodynamic changes. The post-accretion phase witnessed the emergence of regional transpressional shear zones, which notably influenced the distribution of gold-bearing quartz and quartz–carbonate veins throughout the Eastern Desert. A genetic relationship exists between gold mineralization and the transpressional tectonics characteristic of the Najd Fault System in the central transpressional domain (CTD). In the southern compressional domain (SCD), gold mineralization is associated with late-stage brittle–ductile shear zones. The transpressional event, characterized by E–W shortening, occurred at ~620–580 Ma. The shear zones in the central ENS region exhibit brittle to brittle–ductile characteristics, predominantly oriented NW to N–NW. The origin of shear-related gold can be traced back to the accumulation of arc terranes in the ENS, evolving from a phase characterized by compressional and transpressional terrane accretion to one marked by transtensional shearing following the amalgamation. This era also marked a shift from pre-accretionary to syn-accretionary magmatism, leading to the formation of late or post-tectonic granites. The Najd Fault System acts as a pathway for mineralizing fluids, which move through shear planes oriented in NW–SE, N–S, and NE–SW directions. The gold-bearing quartz–carbonate veins in the Eastern Desert are categorized as shear-related gold deposits, with their formation conditions established around 600–590 Ma."

    "title": "The impact of climate change on snow cover reduction in the bare karst system of the Ait Abdi Plateau (Central High Atlas, Morocco)",
    "abstract": "The cumulative effects of climate change on the water cycle components are increasingly alarming. Complex karst aquifers, particularly those with limited data, have received less attention regarding climate change. Consequently, monitoring snowfall is essential for analysing climatic factors, hydrology, hydrogeology, and water resource management. Located in the central High Atlas of Morocco, the Ait Abdi Plateau has experienced a significant decline in snow cover over the past 45 years because of climate change. This paper aims to assess the effects of climate change and land use and land cover (LULC) practices on snow cover within the study area, focusing on precipitation, temperature, and land use and land cover dynamics. Diachronic and statistical techniques were used to investigate the loss of snowfall on the Ait Abdi Plateau. Data from monitoring gauging stations, field measurements (2015–2024), remote sensing techniques based on Landsat data, and spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were combined to examine snow cover fluctuations and their relationship to climate change. Furthermore, the Mann–Kendall (MK) test was employed to assess the temperature variability from 1980 to the actual trends. In terms of results, snowfall shows a steady decrease, shorter snow retention periods, and increasing surface temperatures. Precipitation ranged from 50 mm in 1963 to 372 mm in 2006. This variability directly affects snow cover and melting. Temperature has shown an increasing trend, with a higher average maximum of 10 °C in 1985. Additionally, from 1998 to 2023, winter temperatures have been rising. Maximum temperatures reached 20 °C in the studied area, and minimum temperatures in the mountainous regions were only 5 °C below zero. Furthermore, from 810 km 2 in 1985 to 0.041 km 2 in 2023, snow cover exhibited a notable decrease in unpredictability, highlighting the obvious consequences of climate change and its profound implications on high-altitude ecosystems. Land use and land cover changes indicate high deforestation rates and have a significant impact on soil degradation, resulting in reduced water retention, increased runoff, and soil erosion. Consequently, the decline in the snow cover area will impact groundwater recharge and water availability. Additionally, it will affect agriculture in the downstream part of the study area. These findings highlight the urgent need for sustainable land and water management strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in these mountainous areas."

    "title": "Fractal indexing of rock strength data for safer geo-environmental assessments",
    "abstract": "This study presents a novel approach to evaluating the reliability of rock strength data by integrating specimen geometry, mechanical behavior, and fractal analysis. Fifteen marble core specimens with length-to-diameter ( L / D ) ratios of ~ 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 were tested under uniaxial compression to determine key mechanical parameters: uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus ( E ), and Poisson’s ratio ( ν ). Axial stress–strain curves were subjected to box-counting fractal analysis to derive fractal dimension (Df) values, thereby quantifying the complexity of deformation. To assess data consistency across specimen groups, a new dimensionless metric—Fractal-Integrated Strength Index (FISI)—was developed by combining the means and variabilities of UCS, E , and Df. The results revealed that specimens with L / D ≈ 2.5 yield the most stable and representative mechanical responses, whereas L / D ≈ 2.0 samples exhibit significant variability. These findings emphasize the critical influence of specimen geometry on test reliability and highlight the potential of fractal-based metrics in enhancing data robustness. The proposed FISI index provides a practical basis for geotechnical assessments in urban geo-environmental projects, where consistent mechanical characterization is key to sustainable and safe construction."

    "title": "Integrated multidisciplinary analysis of snowfall, freezing risks, and territorial resilience: a case study of the Wilaya of Batna, Algeria",
    "abstract": "Snow hazards, including heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures, pose significant risks to infrastructure, economic activities, and public safety, especially in regions with limited resilience. The Wilaya of Batna, Algeria, with its diverse topography and climate, is particularly vulnerable to such events due to its varying elevation and localized weather patterns. This study uses meteorological data from nine stations (2014–2023) to investigate snowfall variability, freezing hazards, and regional resilience. Elevated areas, such as Ichemoul and Arris, recorded substantial snowfall (average 144 cm and 134 cm annually), while lower altitude stations, such as Airport, experienced much less (~ 26 cm/year). GIS analysis identified high-risk zones, particularly Ichemoul and Arris, where snowfall exceeded 398.8 cm in extreme years, with temperatures falling below − 6 °C. Due to frequent and severe snowstorms, these areas face significant disruptions, especially on critical roadways, such as RN 77 and RN 31. Conversely, regions with more resilient infrastructure, such as Barika, experienced less impact. The study highlights the importance of developing effective snow management strategies, enhancing infrastructure, and implementing reliable monitoring systems to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of snow hazards. Integrating GIS methodologies with snowfall data offers valuable insights for local authorities to better prepare for and mitigate snow-related disruptions."

    "title": "Shallow and deep structure of the Western European Alps: insights from electromagnetic depth sounding analysis and 3D forward modelling",
    "abstract": "The European Alps are the tectonic realm between the Eurasian and African plate, essentially dividing the Mediterranean Region and Central Europe. The Western European Alps show a manifold geology influenced by the ongoing convergence between the African and Eurasian plates. Mostly investigated by seismic and seismologic methods, electromagnetic measurements complement our knowledge of the shallow and deep structure of this mountain belt. We here present a large scale electromagnetic study that covers a cross-section from Germany to northern Italy and reveals the importance of the alpine mountain chain as an interrupter of presumably continuous conductors. Magnetotelluric and geomagnetic depth sounding data was acquired between 2008 and 2009. Hereby, the quality of magnetotelluric data in the period range of \\(10-10^5\\,\\hbox {s}\\) is essentially improved by Remote Reference and Robust Processing techniques. Thus, constraints from Magnetotellurics could be used to build a 3D forward model explaining geomagnetic depth sounding results in the study area. The main findings encompass interrupted, \\(10-37\\,{^\\circ }\\) S-SE dipping crustal conductors North of the Alps and E-SE dipping in the Briançonnais. The interruption is found to occur at depths around 9–13 km. The conductors top lies between 5 and 9 km leading to a conductance range of 1350–8060 S. Best results were achieved with a resistivity of 0.5–2 \\(\\,\\Omega \\,\\hbox {m}\\) . Furthermore, a lithosphere thickening from around 80–100 km North to 200 km beneath the central Western Alps was found with a conductance of \\(2500\\,\\hbox {S}\\) . The influence of huge sedimentary basins (Molasse basin and Po plain) on electromagnetic data is suggested to be minor compared with the influence of crustal conductors. Graphite networks arising from Palaeozoic sedimentary deposits are proposed to be accountable for the occurrence of high conductivity and the distribution pattern of crustal conductors. In conclusion the proposed model arisen from combined 3D modeling of noise corrected electromagnetic data is able to explain the geophysical influence of various structural features in and around the Western European Alps, adding essential values to the geophysical studies of the region."

    "abstract": "Agricultural drought is a recurring catastrophe with devastating impacts on public health, the economy, and ecosystems. Within this framework, this review highlights the current state of knowledge and scientific studies carried out on agricultural drought, applying a bibliometric analysis to assess the state of the art in drought studies and a systematic analysis to map scientific advances in the use of technologies (remote sensing, GIS, AI). Data on publications related to these topics were obtained from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering the period from 2000 to 2024, using the Bibliometrix R package. The results of the analysis showed a significant annual increase in publications, with 18.44%. This growth is mainly driven by the United States, China, and Australia, which are among the leading countries cited in the scientific literature. This work provides an exhaustive analysis, including a critical assessment of the most commonly used drought indices. It outlines their importance and limitations, a comparison of the performance of machine learning algorithms, with Random Forest systematically superior to other algorithms in its ability to handle non-linear remote sensing data and identify the most influential variables, and finally, an examination of the methods applied in GIS, including their integration with cloud platforms for more efficient, large-scale evaluation. However, this study examines major challenges, including the availability and interpretation of complex satellite data, the inadequacy of their spatial resolutions, and the complexity and adaptability of AI models to various agroclimatic contexts."

    "title": "Integrating geospatial technology and in situ data for mapping and analysis of tectonic lineaments: a case study in the southern segment of Gibraltar Arc",
    "abstract": "This study employs a geospatial technology-based approach to generate and analyze an updated database of tectonic lineaments for the Tetouan-Ras Mazari region in the northwestern Rif Belt of Morocco. For this purpose, eight shaded relief images were produced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM DEM) data, which serve as a basis for extracting lineaments. Lineaments were extracted from each of the eight images. These extracted lineaments were compiled to create a final map of the study area, which was analyzed using ArcGIS ® and Rockworks ® software. To validate the results, we incorporated various data sources, including structural, lithological, and slope factors, as well as high-resolution field data imagery. Additionally, comprehensive fieldwork was conducted to corroborate and compare the findings with previous structural studies in the area. The study identified 488 lineaments, with a cumulative length of approximately 1729.14 km. The lineament density ranges from 0 to 3.32 km/km 2 . The predominant orientations of lineament sets are E–W and NE–SW, closely matching regional fault systems. These lineaments exhibit substantial similarity in concentration and orientation with the regional fault systems. Lineaments are primarily associated with major faults, demonstrating higher density in the southern and northern parts of the study area compared to the western and eastern regions, indicating an elevated degree of rock fracturing and shearing. The increased lineament density in these areas enhances their susceptibility to hazards such as landslides and terrain instability. Consequently, these zones are not recommended for the construction of highways and dams. However, areas with high lineament density can also offer opportunities, such as the potential for water exploration. Furthermore, the results obtained from this research highlight the importance of extracting lineaments using multiple azimuth angles, as they provide more accurate information than using a single azimuth angle."

    "abstract": "The Mougueur El Bour Massif, within the Hight Atlas, represents a transitional zone between the Meseta and the Anti-Atlas. Its geological position has made it the subject of various studies that aimed at understanding the Variscan Orogeny in Morocco. This study aims to produce a detailed geological map of Mougueur Massif using spatial analysis techniques. The adopted methodology is based on the integration of ASTER-GDEM data with Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. For mapping structural lineaments, we employed two complementary approaches: automatic and manual extraction. Regarding lithological mapping, after spectral enhancement of lithological units, the classification was carried out using two supervised classification methods: maximum likelihood classification and support vector machine (SVM). The results of this study revealed four principal fracture systems, oriented N–S, NE–SW, E–W, and NW–SE. These orientations are associated with different phases of Variscan and Alpine cycles. The produced lithological maps demonstrated the high accuracy of the supervised SVM classification, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.96 for Landsat OLI + DEM and 0.99 for Sentinel 2A + DEM. Regarding overall accuracy, the Landsat OLI + DEM data achieved 96.60%, while Sentinel 2A + DEM reached 99.66%. The integration of structural and lithological data facilitated the production of a detailed geological map. Additionally, it reveals a complex litho-structural framework characterized by intense fracturing, especially along thrust zones."

    "title": "First calibration site for Schmidt hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) in Türkiye and an experimental approach on ultramafic rocks",
    "abstract": "Schmidt hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) estimates the age of rock surfaces by measuring their hardness through rebound values, which are influenced by weathering. It is a low-cost, quick, and straightforward calibrated-age dating method. Calibration curves are used to correlate rebound values with known surface exposure-ages. However, accuracy of SHD is highly sensitive to various factors, making it susceptible to external influences. Lithology plays a critical role in the reliability of this method, while environmental factors also exert significant control over the results. This is because obtaining robust outcomes relies heavily on the rebound value (R-value) derived directly from simple measurements on rock surfaces using the Schmidt hammer. In this study, we applied the SHD method to date moraine boulders composed of serpentinized harzburgite, a lithology known for its complex mineralogical structure, in order to obtain consistent R-values. We adopted an approach that diverges from the “established” SHD methodology, aiming to minimize potential misinterpretations and inaccuracies arising from lithologic variations. We designed a sampling strategy by pairing moraine boulders with established TCND ages (control boulders) to those with unknown ages (test boulders) and comparing their R-values. This approach aimed to evaluate the consistency of R-values within each pair and minimize issues related to lithologic variations in the R-value – exposure-age relationship. Our primary objective was to evaluate the consistency of the SHD method in a formerly glaciated area dominated by ultramafic lithology. We also evaluated factors that could influence R-value results and developed an SHD-based glacial chronology. This first SHD application in Türkiye was conducted on Mt. Sandıras, in the westernmost section of the Taurus Mountains. Surface exposure-ages from Kartal Lake Valley and Northwest Valley have been previously determined using terrestrial cosmogenic 36 Cl nuclide dating (TCND) and served as control points in the SHD application. Despite the limited sampled moraine boulders and challenging lithology, a glacial chronology has been established. Glacial landform ages ranging from 19.4 ± 1.1 ka (Last Glacial Maximum) to 13.1 ± 1.2 ka (Late-glacial) have been determined. With this study, not only was the first SHD chronology in Türkiye established, but the methodological application to different lithologies was also expanded."

    "abstract": "Groundwater, which accounts for approximately 98% of available freshwater resources, is vital in providing drinking water and supporting agriculture and industry, especially in arid regions. The Rmel aquifer in northwestern Morocco is a strategic resource increasingly threatened by agricultural pollution, salinization, and overexploitation. This study integrates advanced geostatistical methods, machine learning models, and spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate the aquifer’s hydrochemical evolution and forecast future trends. Data from 2010 and 2021 were analyzed using techniques such as kriging, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and self-organizing maps (SOM). Predictive models, including ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), kernel-based Gaussian Process Regression (k-GPR), and decision trees (DT), were applied to estimate electrical conductivity (EC) by 2030 under climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Results reveal a progressive increase in salinization, particularly in southern areas, mainly driven by the intensification of agricultural activities and return flows from irrigation. ANFIS exhibited the highest performance (R 2 = 0.95). The prediction maps identified zones most vulnerable to salinization and provided concrete recommendations: artificial recharge, optimization of agricultural practices, and regulation of groundwater abstraction. This integrated approach underscores the aquifer’s fragility and provides a robust framework for the sustainable management of groundwater resources."

    "title": "Assessing trace metal pollution and ecological risks in the sediments of the El Maleh river estuary (Mohammedia, Morocco)",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of heavy metals in soils, often resulting from socio-economic development, poses a significant environmental challenge. Metallic elements can be adsorbed by organic matter and minerals in the soil, eventually accumulating in river sediments. This study aims to assess the extent of metal contamination in the sediments of the El Maleh River and its estuary in the Mohammedia region of Morocco and identify potential sources of pollution. A total of 27 sediment samples were collected along the river, covering the estuary, urban areas, industrial zones, and agricultural areas. Samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties (pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, CaCO3, and texture) and heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn). Multiple pollution indices, including the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), pollution load index (PLI), and ecological risk index (RI), were calculated to evaluate the level of contamination and ecological risks. The results indicate that the sediments have a pH ranging from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline (6 to 7.4) and exhibit low to moderate salinity (0.31–9.20 µS/cm). In addition, the organic matter content is predominantly high, with an average of 15.83%. Also, the sediments are characterized by moderate to high levels of CaCO3 (averaging 22.88%) and a predominantly silty to loamy texture. Notably, the analysis revealed that the concentrations of five metals (Pb, As, Cr, Cu, and Zn) exceed the recommended threshold standards, indicating significant environmental risks. In contrast, the concentrations of Fe and Ni in the samples remain within acceptable limits. The Igeo index for Pb, As, Cu, Ni, and Cr indicates that these sediments are moderately contaminated to contaminated. Arsenic displays moderately high contamination factor (CF) values, indicating moderate to considerable contamination; chromium shows significant contamination, and nickel indicates low contamination. The enrichment factor (EF) calculations reveal enrichment in chromium and zinc, with low contamination for lead, nickel, copper, and arsenic. The integrated pollution assessment using the pollution load index (PLI) indicates that lead, copper, zinc, arsenic, and chromium are the most significant pollutants. The ecological risk index ( \\({E}_{r}^{i}\\) ) suggests that lead, arsenic, chromium, and zinc pose medium ecological risks, while copper presents a substantial risk to aquatic fauna and flora. The risk index (RI) indicates moderate ecological risk for zinc, copper, and chromium and considerable risk for Pb and As. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted remediation strategies and enhanced monitoring protocols in the Mohammedia region, focusing on industrial discharge management. Implementing stricter environmental regulations and further investigating potential bioaccumulation in the aquatic food chain is recommended to mitigate long-term ecological and public health impacts."

    "title": "Prioritizing subsidence mitigation in Alexandria, Egypt: a multi-pronged approach beyond nature-based solutions",
    "abstract": "Alexandria, Egypt, faces significant coastal vulnerability primarily due to land subsidence, which far outweighs the impact of eustatic sea-level rise. While recent proposals advocate for nature-based solutions (NBS) to enhance coastal resilience, these approaches are insufficient to address the underlying geological and hydrological processes driving subsidence, such as groundwater extraction and sediment compaction under infrastructure loading. This paper argues that a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy is urgently required. This strategy must include hard engineering measures (e.g., seawalls, dikes) for immediate protection, aggressive groundwater management (including strict regulation, alternative water sources, and potentially managed aquifer recharge), and sustainable urban planning with revised building codes to minimize load-induced subsidence. Effective policy implementation through integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), inter-agency coordination, public awareness campaigns, and dedicated financial resources is crucial. Furthermore, accurate communication of the dominant role of subsidence, supported by data from tide gages and GPS monitoring, is essential to counter misinformation and ensure that mitigation efforts are based on sound scientific understanding. Ultimately, the case of Alexandria highlights the critical need to prioritize subsidence mitigation in deltaic coastal management."

    "abstract": "Quantifying water erosion in basins is crucial for improving the hydraulic management of dams. In Algeria, where water erosion is the primary cause of basin degradation and dam silting, it is crucial to distinguish and measure both gross erosion and sediment transport to accurately estimate the sediment delivery ratio. For the Wadi Isser Basin (4147 km 2 , north-central Algeria), this article estimates soil loss using the RUSLE model and downstream sediment transport based on measurements and rating curves. The RUSLE model, implemented using a geographic information system (GIS) with a seasonal image series for vegetation cover factor C, estimates a mean annual loss of 25.80 t ha −1 y −1 in the Wadi Isser Basin from 1970–1971 to 2016–2017. In parallel, data series of discharge and concentration collected at the downstream hydrometric station of Lakhdaria from 1986–1987 to 2014–2015 indicate a specific degradation (SD) of 2.40 t ha −1 y −1 . Over the common period (29 years), soil losses are estimated at an annual average of 25.60 t ha −1 y −1 , revealing a sediment delivery ratio of 0.09 at the Lakhdaria station."

    "title": "Assessing the relationship between iron behavior and phosphorus in hydromorphic soils: the day Valley case, Tadla Plain, Morocco",
    "abstract": "The availability of phosphorus (P), a crucial component for soil fertility, is usually restricted in hydromorphic soils due to complex interactions with iron (Fe) under dynamic redox circumstances. Additionally, it clarifies how P dynamics and spatial distribution in hydromorphic soils are influenced by redox-driven iron and phosphorus interactions as well as soil physicochemical characteristics. This study investigates the interplay between iron dynamics and phosphorus mobilization in hydromorphic soils along the Day Valley, upstream from the Beni Moussa perimeter, Tadla Plain, Morocco. We used remote sensing, GIS, and multivariate statistical analyses to find that ferrous iron (Fe 2 ⁺) dominates under reductive conditions, enhancing phosphorus solubilization and mobility. Higher Fe 2 ⁺ levels downstream are coupled with higher phosphorus availability, whereas oxidized soils have higher phosphorus fixation. Pearson correlation analysis reveals a moderate positive relationship (r = 0.49) between total iron and phosphorus, which was concluded as iron-phosphorus interactions. However, a strong negative relationship (r = − 0.75) between phosphorus and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) reveals that high CaCO3 levels restrict phosphorus availability. Our work highlights the influence of redox conditions and other soil parameters, i.e., CaCO3 and cation exchange capacity (CEC), on phosphorus dynamics. Remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), multivariate statistical analyses, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) reveal promising methodologies for monitoring nutrient availability in hydromorphic soils and gaining knowledge for improved soil fertility management."

    "abstract": "The Eastern Black Sea Mountains host Türkiye’s largest periglacial zone, with Mt. Kaçkar as a key site for interactions between glaciers and rock glaciers. This study investigates the geomorphological evolution of rock glaciers on Mt. Kaçkar, emphasizing the impacts of Little Ice Age (LIA) glaciation on rock glacier development on the mountain. High-resolution digital surface models and orthophotos created using UAV-based photogrammetry were utilized to analyze rock glaciers’ morphometric characteristics and responses to glacial advances and retreats. The results indicate that rock glaciers situated near the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) formed in the rooting zones during glacial advances that are attributed to the LIA based on geomorphological evidence, such as the position and freshness of moraines, though these moraines have not been numerically dated. This geomorphological evidence also suggests that these glacial advances significantly influenced the Kaçkar rock glaciers, as they likely exerted pressure and caused erosion in their rooting zones. The retreat of these glaciers led to the formation of rooting zone depressions, disrupting the mass balance and reducing the activity of the rock glaciers. Fluted and terminal moraines in the rooting zones further confirm glacier-rock glacier interactions during the LIA, highlighting substantial morphological modifications due to glacial dynamics. This study highlights the role of rock glaciers as indicators of past climatic conditions and their vulnerability to contemporary climate change. The results emphasize the importance of continued monitoring to predict the effects of warming trends on periglacial landscapes, including thermokarst development and destabilization processes."

    "abstract": "The Cretaceous Errachidia–Boudenib Basin in southeastern Morocco is of strategic hydrogeological importance due to its arid climate, irregular recharge, and increasing water demand. This study integrates gravity data analysis, remote sensing, and field measurements to characterise the deep structural framework that controls groundwater recharge and flow. Bouguer and residual gravity anomalies were processed using Total Horizontal Gradient (THG), Tilt Derivative (TDR), upward continuation, and Euler deconvolution. Landsat 8 imagery was enhanced through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and directional Sobel filtering for automated and semi-automated lineament extraction, complemented by field fracture mapping. Results reveal two dominant fault systems trending NE–SW and NW–SE, some extending over 10 km, with dips and depths up to 2 km. These structures strongly correlate with field-measured fractures and are interpreted as major conduits for groundwater from the High Atlas toward the Cretaceous Basin. The integrated approach refines structural mapping beneath Quaternary cover, identifies key exploration corridors, provides a methodological framework for groundwater prospecting in arid basins, and offers solid support for sustainable groundwater development and structural modelling."

    "abstract": "The Tazekka Variscan Massif, located in the northeastern part of the Middle Atlas Belt in Morocco, is a significant geological structure hosting a wide range of polymetallic vein deposits, including lead–zinc, copper, barium, iron, silver, gold, and antimony, mainly within Paleozoic rocks. These mineralizations exhibit lateral mineralogical zonation between two domains of the Tazekka Inlier and are closely associated with a complex tectonic evolution. To better understand the metallogenic and structural framework, an integrated approach was applied, combining paleostress analysis based on fault-slip data inversion with detailed field observations of slickenside-bearing faults. The results reveal four main tectono-metallogenic phases. The first phase involves a NW–SE compression characterized by the development of N30–50 fracture cleavages, N150–170 sinistral strike-slip faults, and N10–40 reverse faults with strike-slip components, mineralized with barite and iron-rich quartz. The second phase, dominated by strike-slip deformation, reflects a NE–SW compressive direction and NW–SE extension, resulting in N20–40 dextral and N60–80 sinistral strike-slip faults, as well as N150–170 reverse faults with dextral oblique slip. These structures are associated with antimony, barite, and sulfide veins within a milky quartz gangue. The third phase corresponds to a mixed compressional-extensional regime with a sub-meridional to NNW–SSE shortening direction and ENE–WSW extension. It is marked by N60–80 dextral-reverse faults, N10–30 sinistral strike-slip faults, and N130–150 dextral-normal faults, which host sulfides, barite, iron oxides, and hydroxides. The final phase reflects an extensional regime with NW-directed stretching and vertical shortening, characterized by N30–60 normal faults with a dextral component. These faults are filled with barite and are responsible for the tilting of Paleozoic rocks. This last phase is attributed to Late Triassic–Early Jurassic rifting that influenced regional basin dynamics and hydrothermal fluid circulation."

    "title": "Evaluation of flood protection measures: case study of the Aït Athmane Center in the Draa-Tafilalet region (Morocco)",
    "abstract": "The risks associated with climate change are increasingly threatening the development of poor and marginalized populations. Extreme climatic events like floods can affect vital sectors such as water, agriculture, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Our study focuses on the risk of flooding in Aït Athmane, located 28 km north of Errachidia, Morocco. This region is particularly vulnerable to flooding and overflows from the Ziz Wadi tributary that crosses the Aït Athmane territory. The specific aim of this study is to assess the consequences of flooding in this locality and to propose several adaptation measures. The methodology followed consisted of GIS processing for hydrological analysis of the basin and statistical analysis of maximum daily rainfall at the “Foum Tillicht” rainfall station using HyfranPlus software and applying various empirical formulas to estimate peak flow. A hydraulic simulation was then carried out, which is a crucial step in interpreting these values for Aït Athmane Wadi, a tributary of the Ziz Wadi, using the “HEC-RAS” hydraulic modeling software. Maps were generated using GIS software, and their superimposition was used to locate potentially flood-prone areas. The results show flows ranging from 60.13 to 92.69 m 3 /s for different return periods, with a main river length of 10.08 km and a concentration time of 125.55 min. Hydraulic analysis shows a risk of overflow, threatening local populations and their crops. These floods can reach 3 m in some places. Several measures have been identified and proposed to mitigate the impact of this significant hazard. These mainly involve simple mechanical corrections such as raising retaining walls along the banks of the Wadi, installing gabion weirs, and designing crossing structures."

    "title": "Structural analysis and hydrothermal alteration detection using satellite imagery: implications for ore prospecting in the Proterozoic Bou Azzer-El Graara inlier (Central Anti-Atlas, Morocco)",
    "abstract": "Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were used to investigate the structure and hydrothermal alteration zones for mineral exploration in the Precambrian basement of the Bou Azzer-El Graara inlier in the Moroccan Central Anti-Atlas. This area is recognized as a Pan-African suture zone, featuring a complex accretionary mélange of various arc-related terranes and dismembered supracrustal ophiolites that host economically significant mineralizations. This domain, situated in an arid region, presents a classic opportunity to utilize satellite remote sensing imagery analysis to identify lineaments and alteration zones that may indicate the presence of significant metal resources. To enhance the existing structural mapping of the Bou Azzer-El Graara area, key lineaments were extracted from ASTER data and compared with previously mapped structures. The NE-SW and EW-trending fault families identified in the study area are consistent with traditional tectonic studies, reinforcing the relationship between these structural features and the observed mineralization patterns (e.g., Co, Au, and Cu). Additionally, the survey identified new faults requiring further verification, which may provide a deeper understanding of the area’s complex geology. The highlighted lineaments correspond to known faults that experienced long-term reactivation during the Pan-African, Variscan, and Alpine-Atlas events. Overall, the extraction and analysis of these lineaments are critical for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones and provide important assistance in guiding future mineral exploration by identifying new potential. We also employed surface reflectance data from ASTER images to map hydrothermal alteration zones. Band ratios were used to generate image maps of iron oxide minerals, hydroxyl-bearing minerals, sulfates, and carbonates associated with hydrothermal alteration assemblages. Combined with available geochemical data, this study revealed that cobalt anomalies are associated with carbonate-chlorite-epidote alteration; gold anomalies are related to alunite-kaolinite-pyrophyllite alteration, and locally with sericite-muscovite-illite–smectite assemblages. Chromium anomalies are related to carbonate-chlorite-epidote and sericite-muscovite-illite–smectite alteration, and high nickel concentrations are associated with carbonate-chlorite-epidote and sericite-muscovite-illite–smectite alterations."

    "title": "A variable increase of debris cover on Pyrenean glaciers from 2000 to 2022",
    "abstract": "The last remaining very small glaciers (< 0.5 km 2 ) of the Pyrenees are the southernmost glaciers in Europe and respond rapidly to climate variability. Most of them are also influenced by local topographic factors and geomorphological processes impacting the energy and mass balance. This paper presents the first temporal study on the changes in debris cover on Pyrenean glaciers from 2000 to 2022 at a regional scale. The data allowed for the first analysis of the lithological characteristics of each glaciarised cirque in order to identify possible factors that determine the evolution of debris input. We manually mapped the extent of supraglacial debris with corresponding glacier outlines using very high-resolution aerial imagery and the existing glacier inventories from 2000, 2011, 2020 and 2022. The results show that debris cover on Pyrenean glaciers has increased significantly in number and extent over the study period whilst glaciers continue to decline and shrink. In 2022, 14 of the 18 remaining glaciers have debris cover greater than 10% of their area, and six have debris cover greater than 40%. The observed increase in debris cover is much stronger for glaciers determined by topoclimatic factors and located on metamorphic and sedimentary cirques, which underlines the important role of paraglacial processes in their development. Meanwhile, glaciers on granitic cirques have lower debris cover and have shown a lesser increase compared to initial measurements conditions. Future work should focus on understanding debris sources and their characteristics to determine the role of debris cover in the response of Pyrenean glaciers to climate change."

    "title": "Integrating empirical and modern analytical approaches for climate assessment of the Inaouene watershed in northern Morocco",
    "abstract": "As the severity of climate change escalates globally, it becomes increasingly critical to reassess the climatic characteristics of various regions. This reassessment is vital for developing effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, human societies, and their economic activities. The study uses empirical and modern analytical methods to characterize the climate of the Inaouene watershed in northern Morocco. Among the key methodologies employed are the ombrothermic diagram, Péguy climatogram, aridity indices of De Martonne, Coutagne, and Daget’s continentality indices, k -means clustering, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and self-organizing maps (SOMs). These tools reveal distinct spatial and temporal variations in the basin’s climate, highlighting a predominant semi-arid climate across the 3608.2 km 2 area. However, southern areas such as the Middle Atlas experience colder conditions. The watershed is characterized by a clear alternation between the wet and dry phases, with the wet season lasting from October to April, though it rarely exceeds 6 months. Notably, the wet phase is more extended in the higher elevations. Seasonal rainfall is concentrated from mid-September to April, with substantial interannual variability. The basin’s climatic conditions are marked by increasing temperature trends and heightened vulnerability to droughts. Under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, the projected future climate suggests further warming and significant climate impacts, especially on water resources. These challenges underscore the need for integrated adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change, particularly on agriculture and water management. By combining traditional empirical approaches with modern methods, this study enhances the precision and relevance of climate characterizations, offering a robust foundation for addressing future climate challenges in the Inaouene watershed."

    "title": "Environmental factors determining the size variability of Globorotalia menardii prior to the Tortonian–Messinian transition: implications for the salinity effect",
    "abstract": "Variation in the size of the facultative symbiotic planktonic foraminifera Globorotalia menardii during the latest Tortonian was studied in the Potamida section (Crete Island, Eastern Mediterranean). The size analysis revealed a complete size spectrum ranging from 330 to 450 μm, consisting of small, medium, and large specimens, as a biotic response to the environmental changes in the Mediterranean Sea during the Late Miocene. The observed size changes are attributed to the widely variable environmental conditions in this dynamic paleoceanographic setting characterized by alternating cooler-warmer and saltier-fresher seawater events just prior to the Messinian–Tortonian boundary. Following the already documented strong relationship between size and oxygen-stable isotopes for Potamida samples, additional linear correlation analyses with the key environmental parameters for the study area revealed a stronger correlation with salinity compared to temperature. Productivity seems to have only a limited effect in such an ultra-oligotrophic setting. Overall, our findings clearly point to salinity being the primary factor of G. menardii size variability through the study time interval. Notably, smaller apparent test sizes occurred during extremely salty, temperate (non-optimum) conditions within the lower thermocline, while larger sizes occurred during freshening and warming episodes within a well-developed shallow thermocline. Between these events, the intermediates reflect the gradual improvement of paleoceanographic conditions for G. menardii . The mechanism hidden behind the size alteration correlates with the differential upper water column salinities with the density of symbionts surrounding G. menardii specimens. This process regulates metabolism and infers changes in the biological processes controlling the foraminiferal growth."

    "title": "Emerging trends and future directions in remote-sensing techniques and platforms for sustainable forest degradation monitoring: a review",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to review state-of-the-art studies on forest degradation using remote-sensing techniques. By analyzing the most commonly used remote-sensing products and techniques, our study provides valuable insights into current trends in forest degradation research. A hybrid approach combining literature review, bibliometric analysis, and systematic review was used. Research studies from more than 70 countries were reviewed. The four countries with the highest number of publications were the United States (21.9%), China (13.7%), India (7.3%), and Spain (6%). It was observed that the number of publications has steadily increased, averaging 300 articles annually. Moreover, they present current perspectives, introducing Landsat (52% of the total) for the detection of disturbances and mapping of long-term degradation. Additionally, Sentinel-2 (6.4%) is used to analyze sudden degradations, such as forest fires or storms. The results highlighted the importance of various processing algorithms, including Spectral Mixture Analysis (20%) and Random Forests (16%), among others. In terms of application scale, most models and remote-sensing index applications are conducted at the regional scale, allowing for an understanding of the diversity and impacts of degradation. For the validation metrics, a non-comprehensive use of these metrics is identified for both classification and regression tasks. By examining current remote-sensing applications and emerging innovations in forest degradation monitoring, this work provides comprehensive insights by highlighting key trends in data sources, analytical techniques, and assessment methods, while also revealing untapped opportunities in advanced Artificial Intelligence models, multi-sensor synergies, and automated change detection. Indeed, this review provides valuable insights to guide future research directions, optimize methodological choices, and advance the development of more effective forest degradation monitoring protocols."

    "title": "Spatiotemporal assessment of groundwater quality in the Feija aquifer, southern Morocco: impacts of agricultural practices and climate change",
    "abstract": "Groundwater in Morocco's semi-arid Feija aquifer, vital for regional sustainability, faces increasing pressure from intensive agriculture and climate change. This study assessed the evolution of groundwater quality from 2014 to 2022 using physicochemical data from 15 wells across six zones, employing both descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses. Results revealed a dual trend: significant improvements occurred with mean nitrate (NO₃⁻) concentrations decreasing from 22.10 to 12.23 mg L⁻ 1 and mean Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) improving from 10.52 to 4.20, indicating reduced nutrient pollution and sodium hazard. However, these positive developments were overshadowed by a concerning increase in overall salinization. Mean electrical conductivity (EC) rose from 1,234.00 to 1,429.23 µS cm⁻ 1 , and total dissolved solids (TDS) from 789.76 to 914.68 mg L⁻ 1 , accompanied by statistically significant increases in chloride, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and total hardness. Multivariate analyses underscored mineralization as the dominant factor influencing quality and highlighted spatial heterogeneity. This study concludes that, while some aspects of water quality have improved, the Feija aquifer is under considerable threat from progressive salinization. This necessitates the urgent implementation of targeted monitoring programs and integrated water resource management strategies to ensure the long-term viability of this critical resource."

    "title": "Episodic evolution and active tectonics of the Karamık Graben in the apex of Isparta Angle, SW Türkiye",
    "abstract": "Isparta Angle (IA) is a significant structure within the Southwest Anatolian Extensional Domain of Türkiye and comprises poorly studied active grabens such as Karamık Graben (KG). KG is a 6–17-km-wide, 29-km-long active depression serving as a key feature for understanding the evolution of the IA. This study investigates the neotectonic characteristics of the KG using an integrative approach combining field mapping, stratigraphic sections, borehole data, and fault-slip analysis. The graben exhibits two distinct fills separated by an angular unconformity: (1) a deformed latest Early Miocene–Late Pliocene infill by the short-term NE–SW-directed compression (Phase-I extension), and (2) an undeformed Quaternary infill (Phase-II extension). A larger lake basin developed during the Phase-I extension and was restricted to a smaller area during the neotectonic period due to step faulting. Fault-slip data indicate that the present tectonic regime is characterized by multi-directional (radial) extension. Deposition rates calculated from the borehole and stratigraphic sections are 0.06 mm/year for the Quaternary units, 0.02 for the Türkbelkavak Fm, and 0.06 mm/year for the Akın Fm, while the underestimated averaged vertical slip rates are 0.170 mm/year for the Quaternary units, 0.02 mm/year for the Türkbelkavak Fm, and 0.06 mm/year for the Akın formation. We also suggest that both vertical slip and deposition rates have become faster during the Quaternary. Based on all these findings, the onset of the neotectonic regime is Early Quaternary in the region. We interpret the Phase-I extension resulted from the slab retreat/tear of the Aegean subducting slab, with a subsequent contraction phase likely tied to the final stage of the Aksu Thrust (Late Miocene to the Pliocene). The Phase-II extension is attributed to the slab-retreat/tearing and tectonic escape of the Anatolian platelet since the Late Pliocene/Early Quaternary. The northern margin-boundary faults of the KG were reactivated by two successive moderate earthquakes ( M w = 6.5 and M w = 6.2) on February 3, 2002, known as the Çay Earthquakes. However, the rest seems active, as evidenced by the findings of this study, and implies a seismic gap. The possible earthquakes to be sourced from the southern section of the Devederesi, Akkonak, and Karacaören Fault Zones are estimated as maximum M w = 6.5, 6.5, and 6.6, respectively."

    "title": "Data-driven analysis of the tectonic history in Greece (1975–2025) and neural network-based modeling of seismic response spectra",
    "abstract": "Seismology, tectonic history, and their importance in the region of Greece have been prominent throughout history due to the numerous recorded high-magnitude earthquakes that have resulted in severe damage and a significant number of casualties. In this work, a group of models created using a feed-forward neural network (FNN) is presented. These functions represent the power spectra of the spectral relative displacement (S d ), spectral relative velocity (S v ), and spectral maximum acceleration (S a ) of the response of a single-mass, single-damper, and single-spring system. Accelerometer recordings obtained in the region of Greece between 1975 and 2025 are collected, and the dynamic equilibrium equation is interpreted for varying values of the damping ratio (ξ) and eigenperiod (T) of the structure, to determine the corresponding spectral values. Following this, a matrix of the data of total size 30,300 was subdivided to obtain a spectrum that corresponds to an earthquake magnitude of 5.5, 6, 6.5, and 7 R. Subsequently, in each FNN model of a certain earthquake magnitude, the parameters of the input are ξ and T, while the parameters of the output are the spectral values. The models are constructed for the total of the components of the seismic acceleration direction: the direction corresponding to the East–West array, the direction corresponding to the North–South array, and the direction corresponding to the vertical Z array. The main results are as follows: the supervised learning rate of convergence is quick, requiring approximately 35 epochs, and the root mean square error is 0.03, which is approximately 1% in relative terms. The main eigenperiod interval detrimental to the structures in the study region is between 0 and 0.8 s, corresponding to fairly stiff to middle-stiff buildings, which are the majority of the real structures in Greece. Subsequently, the probability of a resonance of a structure is increased in the study region."

    "abstract": "Coastal boulder deposits (CBD) found on rocky coasts are considered as the result of erosional and depositional processes by waves. These features are often attributed to extreme wave events such as major storms or tsunamis. Interest in their origin has increased considerably in the past 2 decades, especially after the 2004 and 2011 tsunamigenic events. This study attempts to review the literature available on this topic so far within the context of the Mediterranean region. This study shows how the main aims of research evolved from early descriptive works that tried to identify the causative source or event of boulder transport: storm or tsunami, to more specific evaluation of storm-induced transportation events and testing numerical models. Different methodologies used, as well as technological advances that facilitated data collection and observations, are also discussed. Finally, the study proposes future research directions to address gaps in knowledge relative to coastal erosion and identification of coastal hazards from flooding and inundation."

    "title": "Modeling approaches to enhance the accuracy of streamflow and hydrological signature simulations in data-scarce Mediterranean regions: insights from Oued Issen, Morocco",
    "abstract": "In the semi-arid region of Morocco, water resources are limited and under severe strain. In this environment, watersheds are heterogeneous, have nonlinear hydrological responses, and are characterized by data scarcity. Considering these particularities, using an appropriate modeling approach that considers the unique characteristics of semi-arid watersheds with limited data is crucial for effective and sustainable water management. The physically based SWAT model combined with SWAT-CUP and the low-parameterized GR4J lumped model were used to that end. These models simulated daily observed streamflow and hydrological signature indices to investigate the utility of lumped and spatially distributed modeling approaches in reproducing the hydrological behavior of the Oued Issen watershed. Our findings demonstrated that both modeling approaches performed well (NSE > 0.50 and R 2 > 0.60). Furthermore, the comparison results indicated that the spatially distributed modeling approach outperformed the lumped modeling approach. The latter was less consistent due to its inability to account for spatial variability in precipitation and the hydrological characteristics of the Oued Issen watershed. Compared to the GR4J model, the SWAT model illustrated its superiority by more accurately reproducing the watershed’s hydrological response, specifically in terms of streamflow magnitude. Using the SWAT-CUP program reduced SWAT model uncertainties and avoided the risk of overparameterization. Using the semi-distributed SWAT model with SWAT-CUP proved to be the most practical approach for studying semi-arid Mediterranean watersheds, balancing process complexity with data scarcity. Overall, modelers can rely on this approach for better water resource management in data-scarce, semi-arid regions."

    "title": "Lithological Features as a Factor of Economic Development and Distribution of the Population in the Udmurt Republic",
    "abstract": "Abstract The natural characteristics of a region historically affected the character of its economic development and distribution of population. The most important factor of the landscape differentiation in the Udmurt Republic is the alternation of Quaternary deposit types, which greatly complicates the zonal sequence of soil types. Depending on soil fertility, two background nature management types were formed within each natural landscape: agricultural and forestry. The aim of our work was to confirm the relationships between Quaternary deposit types (as soil substrates) and settlement indicators (as indicators of nature management type). The relationships were studied within the Udmurt Republic landscape zoning scheme by professor V.I. Sturman. Calculation of pair correlation coefficients was the key method for estimating the relationships. The study has shown lower density of population and settlements, low density of the road network, and higher average population of rural settlements in landscapes with higher fraction of aeolian, boggy, and alluvial deposits. An opposite trend in all the above indicators occurs for landscapes with a higher level of eluvial, eluvial-deluvial, and deluvial-solifluction deposits. It has been proven that the strength of correlations between Quaternary sediment types and settlements indicators varies in different parts of the republic against the background of zonal climate changes and azonal relief change. The distribution of geographically incompatible aeolian and eluvial-deluvial deposits, which occupy the largest areas, has the greatest impact on the population distribution. The strength of most correlations has been found to decrease against the general trend of rural-to-urban migration in the period from 1970 to 2020. That was due to the “low base effect,” which leveled territorial contrasts in the population distribution within the landscapes of the Udmurt Republic."

    "abstract": "Abstract A representative collection of diamonds from the Gusiny Creek placer at Anabar in Yakutia has been studied using morphological analysis, infrared spectroscopy (IR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Indicative feature of diamonds from this placer is a high content of the variety V and VII diamonds (according to the classification of Yu.L. Orlov) with a decreased proportion of curve-faced dodecahedroids as compared to other Anabar placers. The lower proportion of curve-faced dodecahedroids is correlated with a decreased abundance of reliefs and hatching on the crystal surface. An increased content of gray diamonds and diamonds with graphite inclusions is also an indicative feature. The proportion of colorless crystals is only 5.9%. More than 11% of the crystals are luminescent under 254 nm ultraviolet light. Diamonds from the Gusiny Creek placer partly enrich the Nizhny site of the Ebelyakh placer, which results in a higher diamond content, but not a higher quality of diamonds."

The countries have been categorized by the amount of hydrocarbon production, as well as by the resource potential on the basis of numerous literature sources. The largest countries, in terms of production and reserves, are compared with the main oil and gas basins where the producing fields are located and the main hydrocarbon reserves have been explored. In the context of the transition to renewable energy sources, this work considers African countries with high geothermal potentials. Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia are capable of meeting the demand for electricity and heat. Various directions of application of geothermal heat depending on the temperature of the coolant are considered. This work provides examples of successful application of modern digital technologies to identify promising sites for further research and operation."

    "title": "Stages of the Paleoproterozoic Chemical Remagnetization of the Kivakka Layered Intrusion and Its Geodynamic Setting during the Breakup of the Precambrian Supercontinents",
    "abstract": "Abstract Detailed paleomagnetic studies of rocks of the Kivakka layered intrusion and doleritic dikes are conducted. Four metachronous magnetization components are recognized. The high-temperature/high-coercitive component, which is distinguished in rocks of the Kivakka layered intrusion, formed during its crystallization at 2.45 Ga. Three metachronous magnetization components formed as a result of influence of hydrothermal fluids at different evolution stages of the Kivakka pluton at 2.05, 1.98, and 1.88 Ga. The comparison of secondary components of various ages for the Kivakka and Burakovka layered intrusions, as well as the Paleoproterozoic mafic dikes of the Paanayarva structure, showed that the Kivakka pluton was inclined most likely during the formation of the Laplandian–Kola orogen between 2.05 and 1.98 Ga rather than during the intrusion as was suggested before. Thermodynamic modeling of the formation of hydrothermal mineral assemblages of rocks of the Kivakka layered intrusion showed that a serpentinite + magnetite assemblage with minor chlorite and actinolite always forms under hydrothermal influence on olivinite. It is established that the formation of secondary magnetite is typical only of sulfate-free NaCl fluids. An increase in the NaCl content increases the amount of magnetite, which corresponds to our experimental results."

    "title": "Astroclimate Benchmarks of Stratigraphic Correlation for Neogene–Quaternary Deposits",
    "abstract": "Abstract An astrochronological (cyclostratigraphic) tie of the lithological and geochemical characteristics of the Neogene–Quaternary deposits of the sections to the Milankovitch cycles (eccentricity, inclination of the ecliptic, precession) was carried out. The relationship between the established variations of climate and paleotemperature with the moments of coincidence of different Milankovitch cycles was analyzed, and a possible detection limit of the method of high-precision planetary correlation was determined. Correlation markers for the high-precision planetary correlation of the Quaternary deposits have been determined. The records in the sedimentary sequence of phases of combination of different Milankovitch cycles, generating climate changes, as well as impact events correlating with phases of combination of different Milankovitch cycles can be considered astroclimate markers (benchmarks) for subdivision and correlation of sections. When analyzing the chronological distribution of impact structures, it was found that most of them coincide in time of their formation with the phases of combining different cycles of the Earth’s eccentricity or with the moments of combining different Milankovitch cycles, that is, precession, obliquity of the ecliptic and eccentricity, thereby marking these milestones in the Earth’s geological history. R.R. Gabdullin proposed a model explaining the correlation between the phases of combining different Milankovitch cycles and episodes of impact events. Materials from the Museum of Earth Science of Moscow State University were used for the study."

    "title": "The Precambrian NENA Megacontinent: Stable Configuration or Phanerozoic Remagnetization?",
    "abstract": "Abstract The coincidence of key poles, paleomagnetic poles recalculated from secondary magnetization components of various ages, and the reference Phanerozoic poles of the East European and Laurentia cratons is tested. The main periods of such coincidences are distinguished. Remagnetization at 1.59–1.45 Ga, 580–550 Ma, and 250–200 Ma during the breakup of the Pangaea supercontinent is established from the correlation of angular distances between pairs of coeval poles of the East European and Superior cratons. It is shown that the coincidence of the Precambrian pole with a Phanerozoic part of the apparent pole wandering path is not always a result of remagnetization but can be related to the repeated position of the same craton in the same area of the Earth as part of different Precambrian supercontinents. The assessment of such “repeatability” showed that the same tectonic block over a period of 2.5 Ga can occur in the same area of the Earth more than two times, which can explain the coincidence of poles of different ages. The differences in periods of the occurrence of the NENA megacontinent and Precambrian Rodinia, Nuna/Columbia and Kenorland supercontinents is probably related to their introversal and extroversal formation mechanisms, respectively."

    "title": "Prediction of Thin-Layer Thickness Using Seismic Full-Waveform Modeling",
    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this work was to select a method for studying the quantitative characteristics of the reservoir properties of the Pre-Jurassic oil and gas complex of Western Siberia by 3D seismic data and to test it on real data. The weathering crust in the Pre-Jurassic complex of Western Siberia is chosen as a methodological example, since reflections from its top and bottom do not differ due to its relatively small thickness (from 0 to 50 meters). The amplitude-frequency response of this interference reflection depends on the thickness, therefore, some seismic attributes may react to it. Full-waveform seismic modeling, using the spectral element method (SEM), was performed for the first time to clarify these relations within the framework of the advanced domestic CAE FIDESYS software developed by graduates and the staff of the Chair of Computational Mechanics of Moscow State University and adapted by the staff and graduate students of the Geology Department of Moscow State University to solve these tasks. This article presents the first results of its practical use. The comparative calculations show that the traditional ray-trace modeling methods previously used in seismology in combination with convolving with reflection coefficients give false results and therefore are not recommended for further use. The proposed and tested technology enables us to construct a forecast map of the thickness of the potentially oil- and gas-bearing weathering crust in the top of the Pre-Jurassic complex in the area of the 3D survey."

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the results of kinetic analysis of organic matter (OM) of 41 samples of rocks of the Bazhenov Formation from one well. The kerogen maturity of all the samples is low (early oil window). According to the results the kinetic characteristics of kerogen, such as activation energy of destruction of bonds, frequency factor, and generation beginning and end temperature could significantly vary within one section. The range of temperature variation required to transform 50% of OM in the investigated samples is up to 27°C. The difference in modeling with various kinetic spectra shows that the assignment of the entire section of the Bazhenov Formation to a single homogeneous rock with similar OM characteristics is incorrect and will significantly affect the accuracy of the resulting basin models."

    "title": "Hydrogeochemical Modeling of Hydrogen Sulfide Formation in a Carbonate Reservoir: A Case Study of the Shanul Field, Southwest Iran",
    "abstract": "Abstract Thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) is one of the processes that are responsible for the generation of hydrogen sulfide in a reservoir. Recently, new hydrogeochemical modeling approaches have been developed to investigate TSR in hydrocarbon reservoirs. These models were developed to understand the basic hydrogeochemical mechanisms for H 2 S production, as well as the factors that control this process. In this paper, we have modeled the TSR process in Permian–Lower Triassic deposits using the Shanul gas field in southwestern Iran as an example. The one-dimensional diffusive mass transport model (PHREEQC) we used is based on equilibrium reactions for gas—water–rock interactions and kinetic reactions for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The simulation results indicate that the intensity of the TSR reaction and the volume of driven H 2 S (hydrogen sulfide) are significantly influenced by three factors: the mineral composition of the host reservoir rock, the pressure drop in the reservoir, and the pH of the formation water. The results show that the mineral composition of the host rocks affects the intensity of the TSR process. The presence of iron-containing minerals can significantly inhibit the production of H 2 S. The modeling results suggest that the presence of a 5% level of iron-containing minerals has the potential to completely remove hydrogen sulfide from a system within 20 years. Additionally, it has been observed that changes in reservoir pressure after production or injection significantly affect the concentration of hydrogen sulfide within the reservoir. A drop in pressure up to 50% (from 600 to 300 atm) of the initial reservoir pressure increases the H 2 S concentration by more than ten times (from 4 × 10 –4 to 4 × 10 –3 mol/kg (H 2 O). In addition, it has been shown that changing the pH of an aqueous solution can significantly change the rate of the TSR. According to the simulation results, a 20% decrease in the pH of water (from 6.5 to 5.7) would lead to an increase in H 2 S concentration from 8 × 10 –4 to 16 × 10 –4 mol/kg (H 2 O)."

    "title": "The First Results of Comparative Analysis of Chemical Composition of Pleistocene Sediments from the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans",
    "abstract": "Abstract The geochemical peculiarities of Pleistocene sediments from the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans have been compared. We used almost 20 000 determinations of elements for the Atlantic Ocean sediments and more than 47 000 determinations for the Pacific Ocean sediments to calculate their mean chemical composition. Pacific hemipelagic clays and volcanic sediments are rather similar in chemical composition and differ from those of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been revealed that Atlantic sediments are, on average, more calcareous than Pleistocene sediments of the Pacific Ocean (32.09 wt % of СаСО 3 vs 18.18 wt % of СаСО 3 , respectively). They are enriched with MgO and P 2 O 5 and the loss on ignition (LOI) in them is higher. Pleistocene deposits of the Pacific Ocean are enriched with oxides of other major elements (SiO 2 , TiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , MnO, Na 2 O, and K 2 O). Mass accumulation rates of all chemical components for main lithological types (except for hemipelagic clays) dominate in the Atlantic. We propose that these results are related to higher ratio of the watershed area to the accumulation basin area in the Atlantic Ocean."

    "abstract": "Abstract A characteristic simplified resistivity model of the earth’s crust has been compiled, which contains a three-dimensional conductive sedimentary depression in a resistive basement. Two versions of the model are considered: with a homogeneous sub-surface part and with multiple local sub-surface inhomogeneities. In three-dimensional modeling, synthetic magnetotelluric sounding (MTS) data were calculated using a system of profiles. In the data for the second model version, the effect of sub-surface distortions is common; it leads to a static shift in amplitude MTS curves and does not affect phase curves. We applied methods for separating local and regional effects in MTS data based on the corresponding decomposition of the impedance tensor. It is shown that under the conditions of the applicability of this decomposition the Bahr and phase tensor methods make it possible to confidently determine the principal directions (azimuths) associated with regional structures (with a sedimentary depression) and not distorted by local effects (of sub-surface inhomogeneities). The efficiency of using maps of principal directions, polar diagrams of the phase of impedance tensor component and of the phase tensor components, and phase tensor ellipses for characterizing regional resistivity structures is shown."

    "abstract": "Abstract For decades the northeastern slope of the Borisoglebsk Upland has been a focal point for natural scientists interested in geochronology and Quaternary environmental reconstructions. A key reference section of the Upper Volga River region is a set of geological cores, exposures and excavations on the sides of the Puzhbol Gully system. The ORV section (Eastern Cheremoshnik Gully) was studied in detail applying a comprehensive analytical approach. We revealed an intermittent geological record of local transformations in the exposed sequence as follows: unstable infilling of a lake depression by mineral and mineral-biogenic sediment during the Mikulino thermpxerotic stage; biogenic and mineral-biogenic accumulation in waterlogged settings during the transition to subaerial deposition in periglacial environment at an initial phase of the Early Glacial; discrete erosion and accumulation with associated slope processes during the Pleniglacial, Late Glacial; and an episode of colluvial deposition attributed to the cold Holocene stage. Hiatuses in the paleogeographic record were identified for several periods of different durations, at least for the Mikulino thermohygrotic interglacial stage and for significant intervals of the Late Glacial and the Holocene, mainly because of the occasional activation of erosion. Stratigraphic discordances exposed in the ORV section have shown its deficiency as a reference one for the reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene environmental history of the region. Nevertheless, we can use the fractional particle size distribution in the infillings of lacustrine depressions and erosion cuts as a sensitive indicator of the local Late Pleistocene lithodynamics."

    "abstract": "Abstract This article describes the first findings of glendonites (pseudomorph after calcium carbonate hexahydrate ikaite, which crystallize at near-freezing temperatures) from the Bazhenovo Formation (West Siberia, Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous). Glendonites originate from the depressed structures of the central part of the Frolovskaya Megadepression and the deepest areas of the West Siberian paleobasin. Glendonite findings have received a reliable stratigraphic reference and originate from the interval of the Ryazanian Regional Stage. Based on the stable isotopic composition, we propose ikaite crystallized and transformed during organoclastic sulfate-reduction in the bottom sediments. Ikaite crystallization might be caused by the penetration of bottom cold currents from the Paleoarctic basin due to sea level fluctuations during the Ryazanian Stage."

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents new data on the chemical composition, content, and distribution patterns of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the natural waters of the Issyk-Kul intermountain artesian basin. The complex geological and hydrogeological conditions of the study region have led to a variety of thermomineral waters in terms of chemical composition, TDS, and temperature. The results have shown that the studied waters of the region have an initial meteoric origin with a clearly defined high-altitude effect and the fractionation of isotopes is determined by secondary superimposed processes. The geological and tectonic structure of the study region contributes to the formation of mineral waters of various chemical compositions: carbon dioxide waters with insignificant TDS are formed within rocks and open cracks; carbon dioxide–nitrogen or nitrogen–methane waters with a TDS of more than 2.0 g/L (sometimes significantly higher, up to 35.0 g/L) are formed when the thickness of the sedimentary cover is significant. Ion-salt geothermometers were used to estimate the deep temperatures of the formation of thermomineral waters, which showed a wide range of temperature values (from 21.4 to 144.8°C), which indicates different conditions for the formation of the studied waters."

    "abstract": "Abstract As a result of the analysis of data from literature sources, the average values of the reaction rate constant for the dissolution of gypsum in water ( k av = 1.48 × 10 –5 mmol/(cm 2 s, 25°C) and activation energy ( \\(E_{{{\\text{av}}}}^{1}\\) = 39 kJ/mol), characteristic of kinetic and diffusion-kinetic control conditions, were determined. The calculated temperature dependence follows the Arrhenius equation in the range 0–40°C (log k av = 1.95–2021/ T , К). An increase in solution temperature ( T > 40°C) causes diffusion inhibition of heterogeneous chemical reactions of gypsum dissolution. It is assumed that at T ≈ 40–42°C the boundary between the macrokinetic regions of gypsum dissolution in water corresponds to the zone of temperature transition between the equilibrium state of gypsum and anhydrite (CaSO 4 ⋅2H 2 O s – \\({\\text{CaSO}}_{4}^{{\\text{s}}}\\) –H 2 O; P = 0.1 MPa). It is proposed that a similar transition in electrolyte solutions should also be determined taking the diffusion resistance of the rate of chemical interactions on the reaction gypsum surface with increasing solution temperature into account."

    "abstract": "Abstract The methods of equilibrium–dynamic modeling have been applied to evaluate the probability of redeposition of previously formed Pb–Zn vein ore substances at a carbonate barrier upon reactivation of a hydrothermal system. The natural prototype is the Ursdon ore occurrence (Dzhimidon ore field, North Ossetia, Russia) in Oxfordian limestone (J 3 ); the formation of polymetallic vein deposits of the region occurred in the pre-Callovian time of the Middle Jurassic. Calculations have been performed using the HCh software package, which includes the Unitherm thermodynamic database (the H–O–K–Na–Ca–Mg–Al–Si–Fe–C–Cl–S–Zn–Pb–Cu system described by 54 minerals and 78 particles of an aqueous solution). It has been established that late low-temperature hydrothermal solutions may provide pyritization, silicification, and the formation of Pb–Zn mineralization in carbonate rocks. The deposition of quartz and sulfides occurs along fractures and at the dissolution front of carbonate rocks."

Nine samples for geochronological studies were collected from different levels of the section for extraction and the subsequent dating of detrital zircons. The distribution of Precambrian zircons in the total zircon population is of particular interest. The proportion of Precambrian zircons generally decreases from 97 to 4% from bottom to top. At the same time, the age distribution spectra of these zircons are similar throughout the section, suggesting a single source for them. In addition, these spectra are similar to those of zircons from the Vendian Asha Group of the Bashkir Megazone, which, apparently, was the source of Precambrian zircons for the Upper Paleozoic formations of the Yuryuzan–Sylva depression. The Riphean rift-related complexes of the Bashkir Megazone and the Archean–Early Proterozoic complexes of the Taratash high were not included in this provenance area."

This article presents an overview of the structure of the siliceous radiolarite part of formations revealed in the section and composing the Bazhenov horizon. Three morphological types of radiolarite layers were identified: well-pronounced layers with erosional boundaries, lens-shaped radiolarites with clear boundaries, and poorly traced layers and single radiolarite lenses. The formation of radiolarians of different types is associated with benthic paleoflows. Areal localization of these types of deposits enables us to determine the areas affected by benthic paleoflows in the Volga age and thus to identify the most prospective exploration areas."

    "title": "The Geomorphological Structure and Processes in Urban Areas of Abkhazia",
    "abstract": "Abstract Based on the results of expeditionary geomorphological studies carried out in 2021–2022 with the involvement of published materials, a large-scale (1 : 25 000 to 1 : 100 000) characterization of the relief of the urban areas of the Republic of Abkhazia (Gagra, Pitsunda, Gudauta, Noviy Afon, and Sukhum) was compiled for the first time. In addition, previously unparalleled general geomorphological maps were compiled, the legends of which were prepared following the morphogenetic principle. According to the morphostructural position and geomorphological structure, the cities are divided into three groups: (1) completely in the area of distribution of the coastal-marine relief (Pitsunda and Gudauta), (2) located mainly within the sea terraces and erosion-denudation hills (Sukhum and Gagra), and (3) completely located in the low mountains with a predominance of strongly dissected structural-denudation, fluvial and slope relief (Noviy Afon). A field survey revealed about 300 areas of manifestation of unfavorable and dangerous geomorphological processes in urban areas, of which 44% are in Sukhum, 26% in Gudauta, 11% in Gagra, 10% in Pitsunda, and 9% in Noviy Afon. The leading places in the spectrum of geomorphological hazards belong to suffusion, erosion, and biogenic processes. The composition of other processes in the spectrum is determined by the geomorphological position of cities under consideration. The widest range, including, in addition to the processes mentioned above, karst, mudflows and landslide processes (i.e., the most dangerous ones), is typical of urban areas with a complex relief structure, an abundance of steep slopes and located within a narrow zone, separating the spurs of the Main Caucasian Range from the sea (Gagra and Noviy Afon). A qualitative assessment of the risk of destruction of street infrastructure (roadbed, communications, etc.) by dangerous geomorphological processes has been carried out and a high degree of its dependence on the geomorphological position of a particular section of the city has been established. In particular, based on the distribution patterns of recorded manifestations of unfavorable and dangerous geomorphological processes, it has been established that the most favorable conditions for the construction and operation of urban infrastructure and buildings are created generally within the leveled surfaces of the Late Pleistocene marine terraces, as well as at the upper levels of floodplain terraces in the large river valleys. Other levels of relief reflect certain disadvantages that make the development of the territory under consideration difficult. Thus, construction on the surface of the Holocene marine terrace is possible only if the foundations are waterproofed and soil is dumped in the lower areas. The development of high sea terraces and erosional-denudation and structural-denudation relief is difficult due to the high density of erosional dissection."

    "title": "Interaction of a Fluorine-Bearing Aluminosilicate Melt and Calcite at 750°C, 1 kbar, and a Variable Volatile Regime",
    "abstract": "Abstract The results of two experiments on the interaction of fluorine-bearing granite melt and calcite with the same initial composition of the dry charge and different regimes of volatiles are reported. It is shown that a significant transport of matter occurs at the boundary between calcite and fluorine-bearing granite melt at given P – T parameters in both cases. In addition to other components, W and Mo are transported from the silicate melt to the carbonate part, where they are fixed in the composition of molybdenum-bearing scheelite. Comparison of the samples allows us to qualitatively assess the effect of the fluid composition in the studied system on the stability of the resulting phases and the probability of the transport of ore components."

To investigate this issue, a methodology for searching, gathering and analyzing scientific papers published in the last decade has been developed and successfully applied. The study reveals a growing interest in integrating Data Science methodology into petroleum geochemistry. This article also presents specific examples of publications found, identifies key “problems” hindering the widespread adoption of Data Science in geochemistry (including the need for result verification, shortage of qualified specialists, issues regarding access to data and negative sentiment towards the application of new methods), and proposes promising ideas for further use of Data Science methods to address challenges presented by organic geochemistry, such as geological assistants, open access geological and geochemical databases and specialized software."

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on geohydrological modeling of the groundwater recharge and resources, their current and predicted climate changes are analyzed using the example of the Vaimuga River basin, Arkhangelsk oblast. It is found that landscape differences in climatic variability of groundwater recharge are significant even over the area of small river basins, and the scale and direction of its predicted changes based on global climate models differ significantly. At the same time, predicted climate changes do not have a significant impact on the formation of balance of groundwater exploitation but manifest themselves in the degree of its impact on river flow."

    "abstract": "Abstract The average concentrations and paired correlation coefficients of elements for the geochemical background of sedimentary rocks in the central part of the Nakyn kimberlite field, which contains the Mayskoye and other diamond deposits, and in the area of the deposit near the kimberlites are calculated. Elements of kimberlites, carbonatites and basites were selected for analysis: Cr, Ni, Co, Ba, Sr, Zr, V, Zn and Sc. High positive correlation coefficients between the specified elements have been established for background concentrations. At the same time, in the near-kimberlite space, while maintaining the average background contents, significant decreases in correlation were found up to its absence between elements of different groups. Differences in the average contents of elements in the compression and extension sectors are revealed. A mechanism for the redistribution of elements in high-temperature (100–600°C) fluids accompanying the explosive kimberlite formation is proposed. The established violation of correlations of background element concentrations in the sedimentary rocks containing kimberlites may serve as a new prospecting indicator of hidden diamond deposits."

As a result of our research, we have made conclusions about the biotic and abiotic events of that time. The stratigraphic position of the section has been clarified and its zonal subdivision by foraminifers has been defined. The paleogeographic and paleoclimatic environments have been reconstructed. It has been revealed that there was a warm-water basin (from shallow-sea to moderately deep-water one) with a normal salinity and an irregular sedimentation rate in the region in the Maastrichtian."

    "abstract": "Abstract Two series of numerical experiments are conducted to simulate the initiation and evolution of subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the northern segment of the Kamchatka subduction zone. The first series modeled the self-evolving submergence at initial kinematic and physical parameters of the subduction zone. The second series additionally tested a new element of the regional subduction model: a zone of kinematic stabilization in the asthenospheric mantle to allow a shallower trajectory of slab submergence. In the first series of numerical experiments (without the stabilization zone) we studied steeply dipping subduction, which is inconsistent with the slab configuration according to available geophysical data, with the full absence of magmatism during the first 14 million years of the model time. In the second series (with the stabilization zone), we simulated the slab configuration from seismotomographic data and plotted the P – T trends (geotherms) for the slab surface and the base of the oceanic crust (Moho boundary). Volcanism was observed in the second series starting after 9 million years of the modeling time. The volcanism is mostly felsic and volcanic structures that are located at a distance of 200 km from the trench; the latter generally corresponds to the spatial arrangement of the Eastern volcanic belt relative to the trench."

    "abstract": "Abstract The extremely high productivity of the Norilsk ore-bearing intrusions is shown. In terms of productivity, it exceeds the largest Pt–Pd giant Bushveld in palladium by about 20 000 times and in platinum by 3000 times. Such a huge difference cannot be explained by any processes of differentiation. The Siberian Trap Formation is the largest igneous formation in the world. The Norilsk palladium deposits, the largest in the world, is associated with this formation and conforms to the boundary of the terminal Permian and the Early Triassic. The boundary corresponds to the most powerful impact event on the Earth in East Antarctica. A hypothesis for the possible impact initiation of a superplume that generated the Siberian Trap Formation and Norilsk Pd deposits has been proposed. Data on the palladium and platinum geochemistry in the terrestrial planets correlates with this concept."

    "title": "Fluidogenic Landforms within the Area of Permafrost Occurence on the Shelf of the Pechora and Kara Seas",
    "abstract": "Abstract This research is based on the results of multibeam echo-sounding and high-frequency seismic profiling, carried out during the cruises of the R/V Akademik Nikolai Strakhov and Akademik Boris Petrov in 2018–2022. Regularities of changes of morphometric parameters and the internal structure of pingo-like features of the shelves of the Pechora and Kara seas were established. A morphometric analysis of pingo-like features was carried out, which made it possible to draw conclusions about their relative ages, as well as the degree of participation of the activity of near-bottom currents and slope processes in their modern dynamics. It was revealed that the density and morphological variety of pingo-like features depend on the geological and tectonic position of the bottom area, the presence and nature of permafrost, the intensity of degassing, and the timing of shelf flooding during the Holocene transgression. In areas of the shelf, where the depth exceeds 70–80 m, pingo-like features were formed at the early stages of the Holocene transgression; by now, the permafrost there has largely thawed. At the same time, pingo-like features retain their prominence in the relief and are actively transformed by the activity of bottom currents, slope and, possibly, pseudovolcanic processes associated with ongoing degassing. In shallow (up to 20–30 m) shelf areas close to the shore, pingo-like features are rare and, apparently, continue to form at the present time. At the same time, the large thickness and continuity of permafrost prevent active fluid flow, playing the role of a seal. Pingo-like features in the shallow-water are characterized by the morphology of cone-shaped mounds and the absence of signs of intensive degassing. At intermediate depths (from 20–30 to 70–80 m), in the presence of insular or discontinuous permafrost, under conditions of high fluid flow intensity in the area of fault zones and oil- and gas-bearing structures, the density of pingo-like features is maximal. In such areas, the localized processes of heaving and active degassing are combined in the near-surface sediments, this determines a wide variety of morphological types of pingo-like features."

    "title": "Geomorphological Indicators of Strike-Slip Displacements on Urup Island (Great Kuril Ridge)",
    "abstract": "Abstract Urup Island is located in the southern part of the Great Kuril Ridge. The island is characterized by contrast relief with a significant depth of vertical dissection that has been greatly influenced by the latest tectonic processes. According to geological data, this island is currently located in a strike-slip stress field. The axis of the maximum compression is oriented in the southeastern direction. This can be explained by the subduction interaction of the Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk lithospheric plates at an acute angle of about 55°. Visual and automated interpretation of space images and digital terrain models and analysis of the erosional pattern allowed us to identify geomorphological signs of strike-slip displacements. These include the echeloned arrangement of lineaments as separation fractures in right-lateral strike-slip zone in the area of the Rybnaya River and on the Skvoznyakovy isthmus, where dislocations of unidentified kinematics were previously revealed. Zones with an asymmetric erosion pattern, which are naturally oriented in the northeast direction, were considered. Within these zones, small tributaries are located on one side of a watercourse of the highest order as separation megafractures. The 1989 earthquake occurred in the setting of latitudinal horizontal tension. In the area of the earthquake epicenter, the linear lowering of relief with a feathery pattern of watercourses was recorded. We interpreted this as a morphostructure of tension. The similar assumed strike-slip zones, which strike generally along the azimuth of 130°–140°, were recorded on the Pacific coast of the island. The orientation of these zones, as well as the kinematics of the proposed strike-slip faults identified from geomorphological data, are consistent with the general conceptions about the stress–strain state of the Southern Kuriles and with the reconstructed main normal stress axes of the Kastrikum Peninsula on the basis of fracture measurements. All these facts point to the possibility of the proposed structural-geomorphological interpretation of the Urup area. In general, our new data on the configuration and kinematics of the proposed active strike-slip faults and morphostructures of tension add to the existing conceptions about the latest deformations of the study area."

    "title": "The Interrelation of Morphometric Parameters of Relief and Seismicity of Sakhalin Island",
    "abstract": "Abstract Our structural-geomorphologic and morphometric studies have shown that seismically active areas of Sakhalin Island are distinguished by positive anomalies of nine morphometric parameters of the relief where their values exceed the median. These parameters include the difference between the hypsometric surface and the third order base surface; differences between the first and the second order and between the second and the third order base surfaces; the depth of vertical dissection; the standard deviation of slope aspect; density of weak zones; the height asymmetry, the standard deviation of the Gaussian curvature of the relief taken by the module, and the standard deviation of heights. It is shown that seismically active areas may also be delineated by the values of the seven mentioned parameters (excluding the last two), exceeding the third quartile. The density of weak zones is the most informative: 45% of all earthquake epicenters and 71% of earthquake epicenters with the magnitude of surface waves of ≥5.5 are allocated to small areas (25% of the island area), where the density of weak zones is ≥36 km –1 . Thus, the example of a well-studied seismotectonic territory shows the possibilities of identifying seismically active areas based on a set of geomorphologic characteristics. This result may be in demand when assessing the seismic hazard of areas with mid-mountain relief, where detailed seismological studies have not previously been performed."

This paper provides an updated review of the evolution of this taxa, with three evolutionary lineages reconstructed: L. batei Malz, 1975 → L. mosaica sp. nov., L. tuberculata sp. nov., L. karpinskyi (Mandelstam in Lyubimova, 1955); L. propinqua Malz, 1975 → L. scabra Triebel, 1951 → L. bucki Lutze, 1960; L. carinata Blaszyk, 1967 → L. interrupta Triebel, 1955 → ? → L. acrolophos Whatley, Ballent et Armitage, 2001. The evolution of the first lineage can be characterized as cladogenesis (the origin of three species from the common ancestor). The evolution of the other two lineage can be described as anagenesis (or phyletic evolution) (species successively replace each other over time). A new species Lophocythere tuberculata sp. nov. is described from the Lower Callovian ( Subpatruus and Koenigi ammonite zones) and Upper Callovian ( Athleta ammonite Zone, Spinosum Subzone) of the Kursk and Ryazan regions and L. mosaica sp. nov. is described from the Lower Callovian ( Gowerianus and Calloviense ammonite zones) of the Kursk Region."

The adsorption of mercury on SGM reaches 0.21 mg/g; the adsorption capacity is 0.35 mg/cm 3 . It has been established that the studied material effectively adsorbs mercury(II) ions; therefore, it can be used for wastewater treatment with mercury contamination."

    "abstract": "Abstract Experimental modeling of processes of oil generation by different source rocks containing concentrated organic matter of continental origin is carried out. It is shown that oil is generated when organic matter is heated, regardless of its maceral composition. The comparability of changes in the composition and properties of organic matter during closed pyrolysis with natural changes in the composition and properties of organic matter of rocks during catagenesis is shown. A comparison of the generation potential of continental organic matter of different maceral compositions is given."

    "abstract": "Abstract The new species Neurocythere margaritae , N. parva , and Terquemula pseudoflexicosta from Callovian of the Russian Plate are described. The first two form a stratigraphic sequence with N. margaritae occurring in the lower and middle Callovian in the Subpatruus–Jason zones and N. parva in the middle and upper Callovian, Coronatum–Lamberti zones. The morphology of both species is identical, but their sizes are different, which allows us to distinguish these taxa and also show their genetic relationship. The daughter species N. parva originated from N. margaritae by gerontomorphosis with minification. The fact that the new species belong to a single lineage allows new homonymous lineage zones to be established for the lower–middle and middle–upper Callovian of the Russian Plate. The species T. pseudoflexicosta is known from the lower Callovian, Koenigi Zone."

The diagnosis of the genus Lopatinia as well as its stratigraphic and palaeobiogeographic distributions are clarified. The boreal basins of Europe (most likely, the Russian Sea) were the center of the origin of the genus. Later, representatives of the genus spread to the Arctic basins, as well as to the Southern Hemisphere in the Notal Superrealm. In the Early Kimmeridgian the genus Lopatinia already had a bipolar distribution."

    "title": "A Loon (Aves, Gaviiformes) from the Upper Miocene of Mongolia",
    "abstract": "Abstract Loons (genus Gavia ; family Gaviidae, order Gaviiformes) are highly specialized diving birds with an incompletely understood evolutionary history. In the Early to Middle Miocene, the earliest small species of the genus Gavia were part of the warm-climate faunas of southern Europe; however, as the climate cooled in the Late Miocene, loons almost completely disappeared from the fossil record of Eurasia, which may be explained by the shift of their nesting range to high latitudes. The coracoid of a fossil loon from the Upper Miocene of the Hyargas Nuur 2 locality in western Mongolia, described in this paper, is the oldest find of the family Gaviidae in the fossil record of Asia and the first find in the continental Neogene of the region. With respect to the size, the loon from Hyargas Nuur 2 corresponds to the modern G. stellata , but is morphologically closer to G. arctica and may represent an ancestral form of this modern species. This find is within the modern breeding range of G. arctica and also interpreted as belonging to the breeding range of loons in the Late Miocene."

    "abstract": "Abstract This chapter provides a systematic description of all confirmed or reliable finds of fossil coturnicines (Aves: Galliformes: Phasianidae: Coturnicini) from the Miocene to the Lower Pleistocene of Eurasia, as well as North Africa (Morocco). Previously published data are reviewed and newly described materials come from the Miocene to the Lower Pleistocene of Eastern Europe (Ukraine and European part of Russia) and Eastern Siberia (Baikal), as well as from the Upper Pliocene of Mongolia. The oldest member of the Coturnicini clade ( Tologuica vetusta sp. nov.) is described from the uppermost Lower Miocene-lowermost Middle Miocene of Baikal area (Tagay locality). Members of the fossil genus Tologuica are present in the upper Middle Miocene of Mongolia and the fossil genus Palaeoperdix , which is here revised and transferred to Coturnicini, is known from the upper Middle Miocene of Europe ( Palaeoperdix longipes Milne-Edwards, 1869 and Palaeoperdix grivensis (Ennouchi, 1930) comb. nov.). Plioperdix (“ Palaeocryptonyx ”) hungarica (Jánossý, 1991) from the Upper Miocene of Hungary is transferred to Palaeoperdix . Mioryaba magyarica Zelenkov, 2016 is shown to be similar to modern Perdicula . Several Upper Miocene through Lower Pleistocene coturnicine taxa are assigned to the fossil genera Chauvireria and Plioperdix , with several new species erected: Chauvireria egorovkensis sp. nov., Chauvireria axaina sp. nov., and Plioperdix boevi sp. nov. (all of them from the Upper Miocene of North Black Sea area). The Late Pliocene–Early Pleistocene taxon Plioperdix (“ Francolinus ”) capeki (Lambrecht, 1933) is transferred to Palaeocryptonyx , and the Late Pliocene taxa Palaeocryptonyx novaki Sánchez Marco, 2009 from Spain and Plioperdix africana Mourer-Chauriré & Geraads, 2010 from Morocco are transferred to a new genus, Marocortyx gen. nov., which is considered a morphologically transitional form between Alectoris and Margaroperdix . The new finds of Palaeocryptonyx donnezani Depéret, 1892 are described, which were previously partly treated as Plioperdix pontica . Some previously published finds of P. donnezani are revised. The oldest find of Coturnix quails in the region is from the Upper Pliocene of Mongolia (Shaamar) and is described as Coturnix augustus sp. nov . Coturnix coturnix is further described from the Lower Pleistocene of Crimea (Taurida Cave)."

    "abstract": "Abstract This article presents the first complete data on finds of mammals of the mammoth fauna in the Upper Yana basin (Verkhoyansk region (Verkhoyansky Ulus), Oldzho River)). A list of mammal species from the locality on the Oldzho River is compiled. Eleven mammal species are identified. Bighorn sheep are recorded in the Upper Yana area for the first time. The 14 C age of the locality is over 49 thousand years. Most likely, it was formed during from the onset of the Karginsky (MIS 3) interstadial This geological age is also indicated by a few bones of species such as musk ox and reindeer. The geomorphology of the locality differs from the typical permafrost sections in the north of the Yana–Indigirka Lowland. The bone bed of the Oldzho locality occurs in the yedoma polygenetical deposits of the 50-m terrace. The erosion terrace socle is composed of bedrock sandstones and argillites, weathered to the state of coarse-grained eluvium in the upper part. Neopleistocene deposits are represented by humified loess-like loams with peat interlayers and plant detritus inclusions, which are overlain by a 4–4.5 m thick ice wedge in the upper part of the section. The bone bed lies at the base of loess-like loams. It is quantitatively dominated (in descending order) by the bones of bison, horse, woolly rhinoceros , and red deer. There are all age groups of herbivorous mammals. Predators (cave lion, brown bear, wolf) are only represented by adult individuals. Pathologies of the limb bones of herbivorous mammals, caused by traumatic injuries, were relatively commonly recorded."

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper discusses records of heteromorphic ammonites of the genus Spiroceras (family Spiroceratidae) in the Upper Bajocian of the interfluve of the Kuban and Urup rivers (Karachay-Cherkessia). The presence of a single species, S. obliquecostatum (Quenstedt), has been confirmed for the lower part of the Parkinsoni Zone ( sherstyukovi faunal horizon). S. obliquus (Baugier et Sauzé) is identified for the first time from the upper part of the Niortense Zone ( bispinatum faunal horizon). The most abundant and well-preserved material (also from the bispinatum horizon) consists of the species S. annulatum (Deshayes) and S. bispinatum (Baugier et Sauzé). Among the adult shells of these two species, two size groups are clearly distinguished, characteristic of both microconchs and macroconchs. Apparently, this is a classic case of intrapopulation heterochrony, expressed in the presence of normogerontic and tachygerontic shells."

The differences between the genera Belebey and Permotriturus are established in relationships of elements forming the suborbital portion of the skull roof, as well as in the pattern of the tooth implantation and jaw bone vasculature. Despite the specialized condition of the dental system of P. herrei and its uppermost (terminal Urzhumian) stratigraphic position in comparison with other bolosaurid species, the morphology of cheek region of this taxon exhibits more similarity with that of the lower Permian bolosaurids other than with members of the genus Belebey . The absence of clear diagnostic criteria currently prevents the subdivision of the order Bolosaurida into two families based on data on its middle Permian representatives."

    "title": "New Data on the Systematic Composition of Early Triassic Ammonoids from the Shimanskyites shimanskyi Zone of the Kamenushka River Basin, South Primorye, and Their Phylogenetic and Stratigraphic Significance",
    "abstract": "Abstract The systematic composition of ammonoids and conodonts from the Shimanskyites shimanskyi Zone of the lower (Smithian) Substage of the Olenekian Stage in South Primorye is revised and supplemented. This is based on the material from the Lower Triassic sections of the Kamenushka River basin, specifically from the Kamenushka-2 and Perevalny sections. Based on the correlation of these sections, it is proposed that the Scythogondolella milleri conodont Zone in this region corresponds to two ammonoid zones ( Anasibirites nevolini and Shimanskyites shimanskyi ) of the Smithian Substage in South Primorye. The new species of the genera Owenites ( O. golozubovi sp. nov.) and Preflorianites ( P. lelikovi sp. nov.) are described herein. The clarification and emendation of the diagnosis of the genus Submeekoceras , and its comparison with other genera of the family Arctoceratidae, permit a reconsideration of the generic affiliation of the majority of species currently assigned to the genus Arctoceras . The obtained results make it possible to reconstruct the phylogeny of some genera in the families Lanceolitidae and Ussuritidae (order Prolecanitida Miller et Furnish, 1954), as well as Proptychitidae and Arctoceratidae (order Ceratitida Hyatt, 1884). The presence of diverse and abundant ostracod assemblages in the Shimanskyites shimanskyi Zone, and a relatively diverse ammonoid community in the bottom waters of the late Smithian marine basin of South Primorye, suggest that anoxia was absent, although it is assumed to have been present in marine basins in other regions of the world at that time."

    "abstract": "Abstract The results of a study of acritarch taxonomic diversity and stratigraphic distribution in the Middle-Upper Ordovician deposits from the Lisino-10 borehole in the west of the Leningrad Region are presented. Six successive acritarch assemblages have been established in the interval of the upper Dapingian–lower half Sandbian Ordovician stages. New data make it possible to link the results of previously studied sections of the Lower–Middle Ordovician of the Moscow Syneclise and the Leningrad Region with sections of the Middle–Upper Ordovician of Estonia. This provides the basis for compiling a complete stratigraphic sequence of the Ordovician acritarch assemblages of Baltoscandia. Three new genera and five new species characteristic of the Sandbian Stage of the Upper Ordovician are described. They are: Lititzina cornuta gen. et sp. nov., Paniculaferum prodigiosum sp. nov., Sandbica clavata gen. et sp. nov., Sandbica ornata gen. et sp. nov., and Tadasum florigerum gen. et sp. nov."

    "abstract": "Abstract We present results of a comparative morphological analysis of the postcranial osteoderm cover of the East European pareiasaurs Scutosaurus karpinskii (Amalitzky), S. tuberculatus (Amalitzky), S. itilensis Ivachnenko et Lebedev, Deltavjatia rossica (Hartmann-Weinberg), Proelginia permiana Hartmann-Weinberg, Obirkovia gladiator Bulanov et Jashina, and Senectosaurus karamzini Boyarinova et Golubev. Postcranial osteoderms provide important diagnostic characters, enabling identification of genus- and species-level taxa. All known pareiasaur genera fundamentally differ from each other in the structure of the osteoderm cover. The validity of the genus Proelginia is confirmed. Diagnoses of the East European pareiasaur genera and species are supplemented by characteristic features of the osteoderm cover."

They come from deposits of the Polyus section, previously dated as Turonian–Santonian. It is proposed that the 50-m thick “calcisphere” limestones along the dirt road on the western slope of Mount Polyus to its summit (outcrop 3177) can be dated as Campanian."

All these burrows have a similar structure and belong to the ichnospecies Lepidenteron lewesiensis (Mantell, 1822). Bone remains and scales of teleost fish belonging to four taxa were found in the burrows: one Teleostei indet., two Clupeocephala indet. and one Dercetidae gen. indet. New finds of L. lewesiensis expand the paleogeographic distribution of this ichnogenus and ichnospecies in the Late Cretaceous, and complement our understanding of the Late Cretaceous marine paleoecosystems of this region."

In each of the six identified types, which significantly differ in structure and microstructure, we have established microorganisms that are characteristic exclusively of this type. Coccoid and filamentous microfossils and filamentous and yeast aquatic fungi have been identified. The patterns of their distribution and characteristics of the material cementing the microorganisms are analyzed in each type of microoncolite. The role of cyanobacteria in the construction of different microoncolites is discussed. The consequences of degradation of the primary biogenic structure in one of the types of buildups created by yeast fungi have been revealed."

    "abstract": "Abstract An analysis of the isotopic composition of chitin (oxygen and nitrogen) was made for the first time for terrestrial and freshwater Pleistocene arthropods from the localities at the Old Crow River in northwestern Yukon, representing an interval from the middle Pleistocene to the Holocene. About a hundred fragments of arthropods were tested among the fossils, including the weevils Lepidophorus lineaticollis (Coleoptera, Curculionidae), some ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae), as well as the ephippia of freshwater crustacean Daphnia cf. pulex (Branchiopoda, Daphniidae). An isotope analysis of extant representatives of the same arthropods from different regions of the Yukon was made for comparison. Isotopic lines show differences between terrestrial and freshwater animals. The isotopic composition of freshwater crustaceans shows the difference between cold and warm time intervals. Herbivorous beetles show a more complex picture, possibly associated with the adaptation to different biotopes and host plants, which allowed the species to survive during climatic and environmental fluctuations."

    "title": "Chapter 4. Evolutionary History of Quails and Allies (Coturnicini)",
    "abstract": "Abstract In this chapter, I discuss the Neogene and Early Pleistocene fossil record of Coturnicini and provide a synthesis of the evolutionary history of the group in Eurasia based on paleontological data. I discuss the early stages of the evolution of the group, paying special attention to Tologuica, the well-known early representatives of Coturnicini from Mongolia and Eastern Siberia . The coexistence of the genera Chauvireria and Plioperdix in the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene of Eastern Europe mark a separate well-represented stage in the evolution of the group in Eurasia. Possible distinctive specialization and different adaptations of these taxa are briefly discussed. In Western and Central Europe, coturnicines are represented by the separate genera Palaeocryptonyx and Palaeoperdix , both known starting from the Middle Miocene. The genus Palaeoperdix comprises quail-like forms, whereas the species of Palaeocryptonyx are phylogenetically more distant from Coturnix and relatives. The Late Pliocene species Chauvireria minor and Palaeocryptonyx capeki are considered as the most specialized taxa within these genera (both probably confined to grassy vegetation landscapes), and the Afro-Iberian taxon Marocortyx is considered a transitional form (showing similarities with modern Margaroperdix ) between Alectoris -like coturnicines and highly-specialized quails. Africa may have played an important role in the evolution of the group, although some of the diversification of Coturnicini obviously occurred in Asia. The oldest occurrences of modern taxa are discussed, with a special emphasis on the evolution of Coturnix quails, which first occur in Eurasia in the Late Pliocene of Mongolia, but spread across Europe only in the Calabrian of the Early Pleistocene."

    "abstract": "Abstract Lake Gryazevoe formed at the end of the Late Pleistocene, about 25 ka cal BP. It accumulated 780 cm of sediments. Petromagnetic characteristics reflect the sedimentation conditions, governed primarily by climate. During the Late Pleistocene, terrigenous accumulation dominated in the basin. The composition of magnetic minerals and petromagnetic characteristics are similar in slope and lacustrine sediments. Magnetic minerals are represented mainly by titanomagnetites. Late Pleistocene sediments are characterized by relatively high magnetic susceptibility (MS), saturation magnetization ( Js ), and remanent saturation magnetization (Jrs). A noticeable change in sedimentation conditions associated with climate change occurred at the Pleistocene–Holocene boundary in the period from 12.7 to 11.3 ka cal BP. Bioproductivity in the lake increased. Due to the dilution of detrital material with organic matter and biogenic silica, the MS, Js , and Jrs values in Holocene sediments are low. The Early Holocene was dominated by chemogenic accumulation of highly coercive iron-bearing minerals, presumably lepidocrocite. Holocene sediments are characterized by the formation of authigenic framboidal pyrite. Magnetic iron sulfides with a greigite–pyrrhotite composition are noted in the transition layers from the Pleistocene to the Holocene. Cold climatic conditions were established in the Middle Holocene in the range of 4.7–6.9 ka cal BP. The sediments of this interval are characterized by increased MS, Js , and Jrs values and a smaller proportion of the paramagnetic component. Late Pleistocene deposits contain a record of paleosecular variations in the geomagnetic field."

SMSs are grouped in the areas with the following features: near-subvertical “microplumes” which a single axial anomaly of the MAR determined by the UU-P07 seismotomographic model is divided into; maxima of Bouguer anomalies between the Vema and Kane fracture zones corresponding to solid mantle volumes and minimum magmatic flow rate; pronounced alternation of spatiotemporal seismicity “voids” and “bands” with a step of ∼1.5°, comparable to the near-surface δVp minima; inversion of spreading rate asymmetry from the east of the MAR to the west within 20° and 24° N south of the Kane Fracture Zone with nontransform south-oriented displacements; and areas with a positive correlation of Bouguer anomalies and the terrain between 19° and 22° N. The relationship of SMSs with the specified geophysical features forms a basis for predicting this type of seabed minerals."

The orebodies are concentrated within the submeridional Opredelyaushchaya vein zone, which occupies the central part of the Mutnovskoe ore field. According to the intensity of development of ore mineral assemblages, the vein zone is divided into northern, southern, and central parts, traditionally called flanks. The article presents the results of a mineralogical study of ore samples from the northern flank of the deposit, taken from core of boreholes drilled during the evaluation stage of geological exploration work. The data obtained in describing the typomorphic features of the main ore minerals are compared with the results of many years of research into the mineralogy of the southern flank. For the first time, hessite and minerals of the isomorphous series proustite–pyrargyrite, pirseite–polybasite were described in the ores of the northern flank. Differentiation of native gold fineness on the flanks of the deposit has been noted, which may evidence hidden mineralogical zoning of the products of the gold–silver stage of ore formation."

They consist of dioctahedral smectite, mixed-layer smectite–illite, illite, and trioctahedral chlorite. In the depth range from 10.04 to ∼20 m at temperatures from ∼112 to 200°C, trioctahedral mixed-layer chlorite–smectite formed instead of terrigenous clay minerals. In the lower half of the sediment section from Hole ODP 1036A, in the depth range of 20–38.50 m at temperatures from 200 to 330°C, trioctahedral chlorite–corrensite formed, and chlorite formed at the very bottom of the section."

Changes in the convective heat flow unloading conditions in the geological structure of thermal fields are considered. Temperature fields on all geological structures of the southern group of the Kambalny volcanic ridge have considerably increased in size over time. An area of the most heated thermal anomaly sites has become larger. Maximum ground temperatures increased by 10°С, on average. Some thermal anomalies (boiling and pulsating water pools and steam–gas jets) increased their flow rates and/or temperature. New heated areas were discovered within the thermal anomalies."

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on large-scale geological mapping, petrographic, and mineralogical-geochemical data, the facies composition and stages of formation of hydrothermal–metasomatic units associated with lithium-fluorine granites of the Severny massif on Chaun–Chukotka were studied. The identification of zwitters of the Severny massif — quartz– topaz–zinnwaldite greisens accompanying Li–F granites and bearing rare-metal (Nb, REE, Y, Li, Bi, Sn, W) mineralization is justified. The bulk of the zwitter mineralization is distributed over the massif area in the moderately altered biotite leucogranites. The facies diversity of tourmalinite metasomatites has been established. Muscovite–quartz–tourmaline, albite–tourmaline–quartz, chlorite–muscovite–tourmaline, and adularia–tourmaline metasomatic facies with tourmaline of three types were identified. A scheme of facies subdivision of ore-bearing metasomatites and a sequence of stages of their formation have been developed: 1) albitites, 2) zwitters, 3) tourmalinite, 4) chloritites, 5) argillisites. The zwitter–tourmalinite metasomatic complex of the massif is characterized by the tight spatial association with Li–F granites, systematic sequence of formation and geochemical evolution, and similarity of accessory and ore mineralization of metasomatites. The ore prospects of the Severny massif are related to the tin-bearing tourmalinite, uranium-bearing argillisites, and rare-metal zwitters."

    "title": "Crustal and Mantle Sources of Lead in W–Cu–Sn Ores of the Badzhal–Komsomolsk Metallogenic Zone of the Sikhote-Alin",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Pb isotope composition of W–Cu–Sn ores of the Festivalnoe and Pravourmiyskoe deposits, flyschoid rocks of the Badzhal terrane, and ore-bearing granitoids from the Badzhal and Silinka complexes of the Badzhal–Komsomolsk metallogenic zone of the Sikhote-Alin was studied based on high-precision analysis data. These data and Sr–Sm–Nd analysis results suggest that the ore-magmatic systems of the Badzhal and Komsomolsk ore districts formed as the result of mantle–crust interaction during the Albian–Cenomanian orogenesis. Based on all the research results and taking into account the abnormal Sn content of the flyschoid rocks and ore-bearing granitoids, the authors suggestt that a granite-metamorphic layer of young continental crust, resulting from orogenesis, should be regarded as the ore-geochemical reservoir of the Badzhal–Komsomolsk metallogenic zone."

    "title": "Dynamics of the Chemical Composition of Waters Emitted from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Mud Volcano (Sakhalin Island) during Gryphon–Salsa Activity",
    "abstract": "Abstract The article presents the results of hydrogeochemical monitoring conducted on Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano (Sakhalin Island) during the field season (May–September) in 2015. Samples of mud erupted by Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano were taken once every 14 days from five gryphons/salsas with different activity levels. Single samples were taken additionally from eight other gryphons/salsas on the volcano. It is shown that mud volcanic waters are characterized by variability of the chemical composition in time and within the mud field area (in different gryphons/salsas). Variations of the chemical composition of mud volcanic waters in time are due to their dilution by fresh atmospheric precipitation on the volcano field. In this case, there is a coordinated decrease in the total mineralization (sometimes by more than 50%), concentrations of all components of the chemical composition, and δ 18 O and δD values of mud volcanic waters. For correct interpretation of hydrogeochemical data, a method of separating such diluted mud volcanic waters into a separate sample is proposed. The method is based on tracking changes in the correlations between the conservative anion Cl – and other components of the chemical composition of mud volcanic waters. Variations of the chemical composition of mud volcanic waters within the mud field area are mainly due to different levels of activity of the sampled gryphons/salsas. The flow of large amounts of CO 2 , which dominates in the gas emissions from Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano, into some gryphons/salsas leads to an increase in the concentrations of some anions and cations in mud volcanic waters. In the waters of more active gryphons/salsas, the increase in Na + , \\({\\text{HCO}}_{3}^{ - }\\) and Mg 2+ concentrations can be as high as 12, 26 and 65%, respectively, compared to the waters of less active gryphons/salsas. At the same time, the Cl – concentration is approximately the same for all gryphons/salsas, i.e. does not depend on their activity. The obtained regularities testify to the possibility of using hydrogeochemical indicators for regime observations of mud volcanic activity and monitoring of underground CO 2 storages, since Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano studied in this article is their natural equivalent."

This paper presents the first results of UAV application to the research of five thermal objects on the Kuril Islands. Four of them (the Kipyashchaya River on Iturup Island, Lake Biryuzovoe on Simushir Island, Yankich Island, and the Yurieva River on Paramushir Island) are associated with active volcanoes. Heat maps with precise geographical reference have been obtained for all sections of gas hydrothermal discharge. Air thermometry for the Kipyashchaya River and Yankich Island were verified by ground data and real atmospheric attenuation coefficients were obtained for different flight altitudes under observed meteorological conditions. The first data on the parameters of the thermal plume from the hot Yurievа River flowing into the Sea of Okhotsk were obtained."

    "abstract": "Abstract The report provides new data on the mineralogy of ores of the Sharom copper ore occurrence, the Kirganik–Sharom ore zone in Central Kamchatka. Copper ores are confined to the central part of the submeridional massif of subalkaline metasomatites. Mineralization is disseminated, less often vein-disseminated in nature.The studied ore samples, collected during field works in 2023, are represented by silicified metasomatites with developed sulfide mineralization. Among the vein and accessory minerals are quartz, chlorite, barite, and apatite. Ore minerals are represented by magnetite, chalcopyrite, and bornite. Hematite and malachite are the most common supergene minerals, while cuprite and Fe and Cu hydroxides are less common. The established chalcopyrite–bornite mineral assemblage of the Sharom ore occurrence is considered typical of other copper mineral prospects in Central Kamchatka and is characteristic of copper–porphyry deposits."

    "abstract": "Abstrsct Tectonic zoning of the African–Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean was carried out based on cluster analysis of a large volume of heterogeneous geophysical and geological data. It is known that the level of geological and geophysical exploration of this part of the ocean by marine surveys and drilling remains extremely low. The results of such an analysis make it possible, in areas with poor geophysical knowledge, to quickly draw up tectonic zoning schemes based on regional geophysical data freely available throughout the entire territory of the world ocean and use them as a basis for further interpretation. The following materials were used as the input data, or classification features: ocean floor topography, free-air and Bouguer gravity anomalies, the ΔTa anomalous magnetic field model, the age of the ocean floor, geoid height data, and the SL2013sv seismic tomography model. For clustering, the K-means algorithm and the Gaussian mixture method were used. Based on the results of applying these algorithms, cluster models of the study region were obtained, in which the selected classes fully reflect the main tectonic elements."

    "abstract": "Abstract The trace element composition of high-temperature gases of Avachinsky volcano was investigated. For this purpose 25 samples of gas condensates and sublimates deposited in four quartz tubes were analyzed. The total average concentration of trace elements (excluding S, Cl, F, Si) in the condensates was 87 mg/L, reaching maximum value of 210 mg/L, with the predominance of B, K, Na, Br, and As. A large number of samples taken during 2013–2023 allowed us to evaluate the variations of element concentrations, their dependence on the fumarole temperature and the season of sampling. The magnesium-normalized enrichment factors made it possible to determine the elements transported in the plume as volatile compounds (S, Cl, Te, I, B, Br, Cd, As, F, Re, Se, Bi, Tl, Hg, Sn, Sb, Pb, etc.) and as silicate aerosol (Ti, Fe, Ga, Al, Ca, Mn, REE, etc.). Ore element concentrations in gases of Avachinsky volcano are similar to those of Mutnovsky volcano (Kamchatka) and are much lower than those of Kudryavy and Pallas Peak (Kuril Islands), volcanoes at the stage of stationary degassing, which can be explained by the higher HCl concentrations in the gases of the latter."

    "title": "Recent Vertical Movements of the Earth’s Surface on Southern Sakhalin Island from GNSS Observations",
    "abstract": "Abstract In the regional structural-neotectonic aspect, southern Sakhalin Island consists of three uplifts with submeridional orientation and two troughs separating them. The organization of a geodynamic GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) observation network in the south of the island made it possible to estimate the secular vertical movements of the Earth’s surface based on interseismic rates in the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) coordinate system. Interseismic vertical movements of neotectonic structures were determined based on data from 29 GNSS observation points, where three to six cycles of periodic measurements were carried out from 1999 to 2012. A characteristic feature of interseismic movements is uplift of the south of the island at an average rate of 1.1 mm/year, which is consistent with geological and geomorphological studies of the neotectonic stage of the region’s evolution. The highest rates (1.0–1.6 mm/year) are associated with uplifts, while relatively lower rates (0.6–0.7 mm/year) are found in depressions. The revealed heterogeneities in vertical movement rates in depressions are reflected in the regional field of horizontal deformations and kinematics of faults that bound the depressions. The obtained estimates of the secular rates of neotectonic structures differ from the map of recent vertical movements of the Earth’s crust. Sakhalin (hereinafter referred to as the RVMEC map), compiled in the late 1970s from repeat measurements of the leveling network and data from sea level observation posts. According to the RVMEC map, most of the south of the island was characterized by subsidence of the Earth’s surface at rates of up to 7–8 mm/year, which manifested itself both within the newest uplifts and depressions and was interpreted as secular tectonic movements. Strong seismic events that occurred in the south of the island during the period of repeated measurements of the leveling network (1959–1977) distorted the RVMEC map as one of secular tectonic movements."

    "abstract": "Abstract The study focuses on determining the origin of organic matter (OM) and its spatial distribution in the bottom sediments of Peter the Great Bay, as well as assessing their contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons. Low-molecular-weight n- alkanes and with even carbon-number predominance dominate the hydrocarbon composition. The molecular distribution of saturated hydrocarbons and diagnostic ratios indicate a predominantly marine origin of OM, with evidence of bacterial reworking. Coastal zones exhibit additional OM inputs from terrigenous runoff and macrophytes, particularly Zostera spp . (eelgrass). Notably, macrophyte-derived OM was detected at deep-sea stations, likely transported by submesoscale eddies. While the overall petroleum contamination in Peter the Great Bay was classified as low, localized areas near heavy maritime traffic showed elevated contamination levels, which may adversely affect benthic biodiversity."

    "abstract": "Abstract The article presents the first results of geochemical and U–Th–Pb (LA–ICP–MS) isotope studies on terrigenous deposits of the inferred Lower–Middle Devonian siltstone–sandstone sequence of the Kamenushka River basin of the Zeya–Selemdzha fragment of the Nora-Sukhotino terrane. It has been found that the sandstones we studied correspond in their geochemical characteristics to sediments that formed in a setting of an active continental margin or an island arc, with felsic and intermediate igneous rocks and minor recycled (second cycle) material predominant in the source area. According to the concordant age of the three youngest zircon grains, the lower age limit for the accumulation of sandstones of the siltstone–sandstone sequence is 459 ± 9 Ma. Large variations in the U–Th–Pb age of detrital zircon grains from a sandstone sample indicate heterochronous material in the source area. The obtained data along with the existing paleogeodynamic models for the formation of the South Mongolia–Khingan orogenic belt suggest that the main sources of clastic material were Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic igneous rocks of the Mamyn terrane, as well as Early Paleozoic island-arc rocks of the Nora-Sukhotino terrane."

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on seismic energy, earthquake density, and Morishita index data, a map of Priamurye seismic lineaments that can serve as rupture indicators has been constructed. The identified seismic lineaments have been compared with the known faults identified based on geological data and indirect signs of hidden faults: linear magnetic and gravity anomalies, V p / V s velocity ratios, and lineaments based on relief analysis. Of the 33 constructed seismic lineaments, 23 (13 regional and 10 local ruptures) are consistent in individual segments with known geological faults, while 10 do not correlate with known faults. At the same time, six seismic lineaments from the last group have other indirect signs of faults typical of hidden modern active faults. The identified seismic lineaments have different orientations without predominant directions. No significant differences were found in the manifestation of seismic lineaments constructed based on the analysis of weak and fairly strong earthquakes."

    "title": "Mechanism for Cretaceous Turbidite Deposition in Lower Priamurye",
    "abstract": "Abstract The deposition mechanism for Cretaceous turbidites in Lower Priamurye, just like all turbidites in general, is based on the hydrodynamic regime in their accumulation basin. The scheme of the hydrodynamic regime of turbidite sedimentation is given using the Berriasian–Valanginian basin of the Gorinsky terrane as an example. Sediments from the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent accreted at the continental slope to be moved eastward to its base by turbidity currents created by submarine slumping of sediments. The coarse material of the landslides settled out first, and fine-grained particles were carried by turbidity currents further east into the deeper parts of the basin. At the base of the slope, turbidity currents interacted with bottom currents, which would circulate at the base of the continental slope as large-scale eddies. Coarse-grained clastic turbidites were deposited from the highly turbulent (high-velocity) flows oriented from west to east. As they moved further east, the turbidity currents weakened and deviated to acquire first a submeridional (from south to north) orientation, then sublatitudinal (from east to west). As a result, sandy turbidites were deposited from submeridional turbidity currents, while sandy–clayey and silty–clayey cyclites from sublatitudinal currents. During periods of the generally diminished tectonic activity in the region when the influence of turbidity currents decreased, only bottom currents circulated in the basin to form narrow horizons of contourites. The area where sandy turbidites accumulated could later on become an arena for the accumulation of sandy–clayey and silty–clayey turbidites and vice versa. As a result of frequent changes in the hydrodynamic regime, a sedimentary section was formed represented by alternating different types of turbidites and, to a lesser extent, contourites."

    "abstract": "Abstract The study examines petrogeochemical characteristics of Late Permian granitoids in the Gamov batholith. The petrological and geochemical data indicate the presence of two groups of granitoids: S- and I-type. The rocks are predominantly magnesian, calcareous and calc-alkaline, and moderately and highly aluminous. They demonstrate higher Rb, Ba, Th, U, K, Pb, and LREE concentrations and lower Nb, Sr, P, and Ti concentrations. The distribution of rare earth elements is moderately fractionated. The topology of the distribution spectrum of rare elements is similar for all types of rocks, differing only in the size of anomalies of individual elements. An evaluation of the PT parameters of crystallization of the main phase—biotite–amphibole granites and granodiorites—showed that they formed at a temperature of 666–818°C and pressure of 2.1–2.8 kbar. The Nd isotopic composition of granites indicates the involvement of crustal and mantle material in magma formation, the contribution of the latter reaching 50%. The emplacement of the Gamov batholith is associated with closure of the Solonker Paleo-Asian Ocean in the Late Permian."

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents information on the deep structure of dynamically active regions of Central and Eastern Kamchatka in the island arc junction. It also discusses the inferred genetic relation of the ultramafic rocks and copper-nickel mineralization to the structural features of lithosphere in the continent–ocean transition zone. The paper reports the results of integrated interpretation of geophysical data derived by earthquake converted-wave method (ECWM), magnetotelluric sounding (MTS), gravity and magnetic surveys, as well as geological surveys carried out in the area of the Klyuchevskoy Group of volcanoes and Kamchatsky Mys Peninsula. For the first time, a geological and geophysical model has been developed for the Krapivnoe village–Cape Africa geophysical profile. The model shows the main boundaries of the lithosphere and identifies previously unknown elements of the Earth’s crust and upper mantle. In the western part of the model, an NE-dipping upper mantle layer is identified, the present-day movement of which can be explained by the involvement of the lower layer of the Eastern Kamchatka lithosphere in subduction of the oceanic plate beneath the Aleutian–Commander Arc. The dynamics of interaction between the oceanic and continental lithospheric plates is shown. Two subduction zones that have existed successively in the past are demonstrated schematically. The upper part of the second subducting slab contains a 12–16 km thick layer consisting of ophiolite sheets and blocks of ultramafic and mafic composition. One of the identified blocks in the layer is presumably a part of an ultramafic massif with copper-nickel mineralization. An extension zone located downsection is confined to the area of maximum slab bending. Natural thermal vents in the Cape Africa areas suggest the circulation of high-temperature solutions in the extension zone. The upper part of the model includes a block identified as a fragment of the Achaivayam–Valaginsky terrane. The block is represented by discrete sheet-like fragments of varying density, which are inclined in the eastern direction and consist of two layers 6 km of total thickness. The upper layer is made up of an allochthonous sheet, the frontal part of which consists of Paleocene–Eocene deposits thrust over the western slope of the Tyushevsky trough filled with Oligocene–Miocene deposits. The thrust was caused by the Central Kamchatka rift extension. The Tyushevsky trough was inherited from the accretion zone. Two areas where the trough base demonstrates submergence to a depth of 6 and 7 km are inherited from the deep-sea paleo-trenches formed during successive subductions."

    "abstract": "Abstract New data on the composition of the pyroclastic deposits of the Krasheninnikov caldera allowed us to correlate it to the previously studied tephra horizon Geys30, which until recently was erroneously attributed to an eruption within the Geysernaya caldera. Deposits of pyroclastic density currents from the eruption that led to the formation of the Krasheninnikov caldera were found on the caldera’s rim and along the southern shore of Kronotsky Lake. Its distal tephra was found in the sediments of the Central Kamchatka Depression (CKD) at a distance of up to 200 km from the source. The age of this tephra was previously estimated at ∼30 ka, which now allows us to accept this estimate for the Krasheninnikov caldera. The identification of tephra of the caldera-forming eruption in distal sites allows for a minimum estimate of the erupted pyroclastic volume of ∼13 km 3 and the eruption magnitude at 6.1."

    "abstract": "Abstract The strongest eruption of the Young Shiveluch Volcano (Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia) in the last 60 years occurred on April 10, 2023. This eruption was preceded by long-term seismic activity since the end of July 2022. Earthquakes of that time were mainly long-period and occurred in the squeezing out extrusive dome. This paper describes the grouping of earthquakes into families in terms of their waveform similarity and based on comparison with the activity of the Young Shiveluch Volcano. In the period of steady constant-velocity dome extrusion, when the pressure did not vary in the vent, earthquakes were grouped into long-term families. The period before the culmination phase was characterized by a greater number of families interpreted as an indicator of the unstable environment. Such increase in the number of earthquake families makes it possible to predict more accurately the beginning of the eruption culmination phase of the andesitic Young Shiveluch Volcano."

    "abstract": "Abstract The southern flank deep structure of the Kuvalorog intrusion, located in the Kvinum–Kuvalorog nickel-bearing zone of the Sredinny Ridge (Kamchatka), was investigated. A volumetric density distribution model up to a depth of 5 km below sea level was developed using the density modeling method. Massive blocks with density similar to basitic rocks of the nickel-bearing plutonic Dukuk gabbro–peridotite complex were localised. These dense blocks formed two stages, which represented the chambers of a single magmatic system. The upper stage corresponded to the exposed part of the Kuvalorog intrusion, while the lower stage consisted of separate blocks located at depths ranging from 0 to 2 km. Massive blocks of both stages were connected by arc conductors of complex shape. Small basite bodies exposed southwest of the main intrusion could be considered apophyses of the conductors. The volume of hidden magma chambers of the lower stage were quantitatively estimated, and the theoretical amount of metals contained in them was assessed. The average nickel, copper, and cobalt contents in rocks of the nickel-bearing complex exceed crustal background values by 1.5–3 times. The largest resources (on the order of millions of tons) were found in the massive block in the vicinity of the interfluve of the Kikhchik and Pravaya Kikhchinskaya rivers. The nickel content was found to be 1.71; the copper content, 0.80; and the cobalt content, 0.51. The quantity of metallogenic resources present in the magma chambers of the lower stage was found to be the minimum possible."

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper presents the results of petrological, mineralogical and geochemical studies of igneous rocks from the subvolcanic gabbro-diorite intrusion and host volcanics of the Aginskoe gold–silver–telluride deposit located in the Central Kamchatka volcanic belt. Igneous rocks connected by multiple mutual transitions are represented by gabbro, gabbro-diorites, diorites, quartz diorites, and granites. In terms of composition, the rocks correspond to moderate- and high-potassium calc-alkaline petrochemical series. The host volcanics are comagmatic with the intrusive rocks. The main fluorine and chlorine concentrating minerals in igneous rocks are biotite and apatite. Apatites are essentially fluorine with a reduced content of chlorine. The Aginsky gabbro-diorite massif is a complex multiphase intrusion formed in an island-arc geodynamic setting. The formation of intrusive phases occurred in the temperature range 450–1300°C and was accompanied by a decrease of chlorine contents and accumulation of fluorine at intensive degassing of the magmatic melt."

    "abstract": "Abstract This article summarizes research results obtained for Late Proterozoic (1.32–1.15 Ga) ore-bearing (U, Mo, V, Zn, and Ag) quartz–light-colored mica metasomatic rocks of the Uchur–Ulkan region in the eastern Aldan Shield. Large faults and zones with structural and stratigraphic unconformities govern the development of mineralization. The study of the mineral composition of metasomatic rocks resulted in identification of sericite, hydrosericite, and roscoelite metasomatic rocks with quartz. Wallrock metasomatic features were described in gneisses, marbles, and volcanosedimentary rocks, and metasomatic zoning was revealed in rocks of different types. The overprinted metamorphic processes could be related to Late Proterozoic rejuvenation processes and extraction of ore components from rocks of the Ulkan Complex (1.72–1.68 Ga) at the metamorphic basement of the Siberian Platform and its platform cover. It is concluded that structural settings, age, and a number of composition characteristics, uranium ore deposits in the eastern Aldan Shield are similar to the Canadian and Onega “unconformity-type” deposits."

The hydrocarbon-bearing sediments are mainly represented by aleuritic varieties with psammitic (up to 46%) and pelitic (up to 43%) components. The maximum contents of Si, Ti, K, Ca, Sr, Zr, and Y are noted in the bottom sediments of coastal shelf zones; the concentrations of S, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, V, Fe, Mn, Rb increase in the shelf–bathyal direction. Sediments with anomalous methane contents are significantly enriched in S, Mn, V, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pb. The data obtained make it possible to suggest the presence of sources of hydrocarbon migration and to consider further the prospects of detailed works for the assessment of the oil, gas and gas hydrate potential in the southern part of the Tatar Strait. The research corresponds to the tasks of the working group “Gas hydrates and methane flows in the Indo-Pacific region” of the WESTPAC subcommittee of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO."

    "abstract": "Abstract The article presents the results of lithological–petrographical and geochemical, including isotopic (δ 13 C, δ 18 O), analyses of carbonate rocks of the Alyarmaut uplift. Three types of Tournaisian–Visean terrigenous–carbonate rocks have been identified: (1) dark gray carbonate shales with increased REE and organic matter contents; (2) light gray marbleized limestones; (3) white thick-slabby limestones. The REE and organic matter contents gradually decrease from the bottom upsection—from the first to the third types. All three types accumulated on an open carbonate platform, the provenance area of which comprised predominantly felsic rocks with the probable subordinate involvement of mafic–ultramafic rocks."

    "abstract": "Abstract The use of certain research methods to determine the potential of a territory for certain types of minerals requires specialized software with mandatory compatibility with common types of data, support for major operating systems, and a simple graphical interface for comfortable operation by a wide range of users. In addition to research tools, the program should be able to save results in common file formats. The base surfaces method, based on topographic calculations with a detected erosion network, is used to identify the amplitude of relief uplifts and subsidences and to delineate local areas of neotectonic movements. In relation to predicting the mineral resource potential of the territory, the compiled maps of the orders of base surfaces and their difference maps in combination with other data sources make it possible to identify overlapping, potentially ore-bearing intrusions and placer sources. The study considers the ENOE 0.6a program and its application to analyzing ore-bearing structures of the Sikhote-Alin mobile belt with the example of gold placers in the territory adjacent to the Bekchiul multiphase pluton, which contains the large Mnogovershinnoe gold–silver deposit. With ENOE, a dataset was created describing neotectonic processes and the development of the erosion network. Based on the obtained materials, including geological, a predictive machine learning model was trained and tested, created using the maximum entropy method, which made it possible to outline known placer ore objects. Validation and application of the model to a control site demonstrated its efficiency as a preliminary analysis tool for the area."

    "abstract": "Abstract Gravitational field inversion technologies aimed at creating three-dimensional detailed models of a real geological medium are constantly being improved, but the basic principles of solving inverse problems remain unchanged, violation of which prevents one from obtaining a geologically meaningful result. The method of creating three-dimensional density models of a medium presented in the article by M.D. Sidorov and Yu.P. Trukhin, as well as in other studies by the authors, raises a number of questions, of which the main and fundamental is the correctness of applying 2D density modeling when studying a three-dimensional geological object. The correctness of passing from two- to three-dimensional models needs to be confirmed by simulation modeling. The absence of such constructions leads to the production of typical “compensatory” sections that are inadequate for the real density distribution. Another aspect is the degree of detail of the resulting 3D model of the medium compiled from the results of 2D modeling, which of course depends on the detail of the initial gravitational field. The quality and reliability of the results should be confirmed by solving the direct 3D gravimetry problem from the created model of the medium."

    "title": "Geochemistry of Upper Triassic Deposits of Southwestern Primorye as an Indicator of Source Areas and Tectonic Settings of Formation",
    "abstract": "Abstract In southwestern Primorye, the Upper Triassic is represented by the continental, often coal-bearing Mongugai Formation, which is part of the Laoeling–Grodekovo terrane, a fragment of the eastern edge of the Central Asian fold belt. The lithological composition of terrigenous rocks of the Mongugai Formation has been poorly studied; therefore, the aim of this article is to study in detail the geochemical composition of its sandy rocks and, based on genetic interpretation, to clarify geodynamic deposition environments and to determine the type and composition of rocks in source areas. As a result of the research, it was established that in their geochemical parameters, sandstones are homogeneous and are attributed to graywackes and, in part, lithic arenites. The rocks are rock-forming, having gone through one resedimentation cycle, and are characterized by a significant degree of chemical maturity of the clastic material, suggesting their formation due to the erosion of significantly weathered rocks of denudation areas. The specific features of the geochemical composition of sandy rocks, as well as the results of its paleogeodynamic interpretation, indicate that in the Late Triassic in southwestern Primorye, terrigenous deposits accumulated in an active continental margin setting, most likely complicated by strike-slip dislocations along transform faults. The main source area was a continental land composed of granite–metamorphic complexes and sedimentary rocks. Additional sources of clastics were granitoids of the root part of the deeply eroded ensialic arc, as well as the intermediate and basic volcanites from underlying Permian deposits."

    "abstract": "Abstract Cretaceous and Paleogene magmatic rocks consisting of calc-alkaline diorite–granite and andesite–rhyolite suites were dredged from the Kashevarov Bank. Among them, Cretaceous adakite granitoids and Late Cretaceous–Paleocene and Eocene adakite volcanics were identified by high Sr/Y ratios with low concentrations of Y and Yb. The igneous complexes of the Kashevarov Bank and other submarine rises in the northern Sea of Okhotsk are similar to coeval complexes of the Sikhote-Alin and northern Priokhotye or western Kamchatka, where granitoid emplacement is considered as having resulted from island arc collisions in the Albian–Cenomanian or the Early Eocene, respectively. It is suggested that the formation of adakitic granitoids is associated with destruction of the slab and upwelling of subslab asthenosphere. There is a boundary between the Albian–Cenomanian and Eocene orogenic belts and consequently different-aged blocks of continental crust in the area of the Kashevarov Bank. The Eocene collision zone can be traced from the Malkino Rise of western Kamchatka through the Kashevarov Bank and central Sakhalin to central Hokkaido. Island arc collisions—Early Eocene in Kamchatka and Middle Eocene on Sakhalin and Hokkaido—culminated in the formation of the continental crust that existed before the formation of the Sea of Okhotsk. We present a new tectonic zoning scheme of the Sea of Okhotsk basement and reconstructions of the continental margin before the opening of the Sea of Okhotsk."

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper summarizes data on the historical activity of Ivan Grozny volcano (Iturup Island, Kuril Islands), including the results of original studies of sulfur hydrothermal and eruptive activities of the volcano since 2004. New chemical data on the volcanic edifice rocks and pyroclastics of the last explosive eruption in 2012–2013 are presented. The composition of the volcanic edifice rocks varies from andesites to dacitic andesites (58.16–61.42 wt % SiO 2 ) of the medium potassium series (0.93–1.14 wt % K 2 O). Pyroclastics from the 2012–2013 explosive eruption chemically correspond to andesites (57.20–59.54 wt % SiO 2 ) with moderate potassium contents (0.95–1.05 wt % K 2 O). According to microprobe studies, glasses have much more felsic compositions. The values obtained are similar to the geochemical compositions of the products of the 1973 and 1989 eruptions. Taking into account the dominant wind regime in central Iturup Island, the hazard from ashfalls from future eruptions of Ivan Grozny volcano is estimated, indicating the predominant ash spread in the northwestern, western, and southwestern directions."

    "title": "On the Role of Endogenic and Exogenic Factors in the Formation of High-Grade Ores and Ore Shoots in the Vein Bodies of the Low-Sulfidation Tokur Gold Deposit (Amur Region)",
    "abstract": "Abstract Using the low-sulfidation Tokur gold–quartz deposit as an example, the long-debated problem of the genesis and relationships of primary and secondary ore shoots in low-sulfidation gold–quartz deposits (with sulfide contents of 0.5–2.5%) is considered as the basis for assessing their prospects and choosing a strategy for exploration or additional exploration of ore objects of this type of formation. Our research has established that the primary and oxidized ores of the vein bodies of this deposit are identical in grain size of native gold, primary mineral parageneses, spatial distribution of gold in vein bodies, and the composition of fluid inclusions. Thus, the rich gold of the oxidized ores of this deposit at subsurface levels was also formed at the hydrothermal stage. The low contents of dispersed gold in the sulfides of primary low-sulfidation ores (on average, 15–35g/t) and small amounts of sulfides in such orebodies make it virtually impossible for economically important secondary concentrations to form in the oxidation zone. Consequently, outcrops of gold-rich oxidized ores found on the surface of low-sulfidation deposits should be considered reliable indicators of the localization of primary ore shoots in them and, hence, the prospects of these vein bodies at depth. This should be taken into account when choosing directions for further deep exploration and additional exploration of ore objects that have been mined only at subsurface levels. Based on the examination of gold distribution in numerous eroded and “blind” vein bodies of this deposit, we have substantiated the spatial-genetic relation of the formation of primary gold ore shoots with areas of maximum openings of cavities, which at present are represented by swells of these bodies. The opening of the cavities led to a sharp decrease in fluid pressure, its supersaturation with gold, and a change in the gold transport forms. We believe that the gold was transported by fluids from the sites of a sharp pressure decrease to higher localization levels of ore shoots not only as soluble complexes, but also in solid-phase form according to the mechanism of its natural gas flotation, with the formation of nanonuclei of hydrophobic gold and their Au сr + gas bubble associates on evaporation barriers along the peripheries of released and growing gas bubbles during boiling, heterogenization, degassing, and supersaturation of the fluid with gold, gases and other components. The mechanism of effective solid-phase gold transport during ore formation was modeled in laboratory experiments."

    "abstract": "Abstract The article focuses on the nature of olivine–plagioclase (allivalite) spherulites from a young basaltic andesite lava flow of Kudryavy volcano. The spherulites consist mainly of olivine (Fo 81–77 ) and plagioclase (An 95–92 ) and have a radial structure, which is not typical of allivalites of the Kuril–Kamchatka region. The study of the mineral composition and primary melt inclusions in olivine showed that they formed from a low-alumina, low-potassium melt at temperatures of 970–1075°C and oxygen fugacity corresponding to the NNO + 1.6 – NNO + 2 buffer. A characteristic feature of the initial melts was their elevated water content (4.2 wt % on average). The structural features of the spherulites suggest that the formation of dendritic zones could have occurred during decompression of the shallow chamber under Kudryavy volcano at the beginning of the eruption, with a sharp decrease in temperature by 50–70°C. The coarsely crystalline central zones of spherulites confirm the cumulative nature of their formation. The formation of central zones could have occurred during the destruction of layers and crusts of cumulates on their entry into melts heading to the surface."

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports new data on the copper mineralization in the Pribrezhny Volcanic Complex (PVC), which is a part of the Eastern Kamchatka–Kurile volcanic plutonic belt (part of the Kurile-Southern Kamchatka island-arc system). The study area is situated along the eastern coast of the southern Kamchatka Peninsula, from Avacha Bay to Mutnaya Bay. It was found that the majority of collected volcanic and intrusive rocks have the elevated copper contents compared to the clarke values. The sources of copper in the PVC rocks are debatable, and this paper considers its possible origin. The distribution of porphyry copper deposits on other island arcs of the Pacific Ring in similar tectonic settings highlights the need for searching similar deposits in the coastal band of southeastern Kamchatka. Based on the geology, structure, and composition of the PVC, the authors admit the principal possibility of the existence of unexposed porphyry copper systems. Obtained results could be used for substantiation of thematic prospecting."

    "abstract": "Abstract In the Nikolaevka-1 quarry (53°05′17.45″ N, 158°21′26.28″ E), in lake sediments formed about 100 000 years ago, we found buried ash layers. Geochemical analysis of the volcanic glass from these ash layers allowed, for the first time, the identification of three Late Pleistocene tephras from the Avachinsky volcano labeled 21/23, 21/4, and 21/10. In addition, we found a tephra labeled DS7 from one of the centers of the Karymsky volcanic area, dated to ∼107 ka. The stratigraphic position of Avachinsky ash relative to the DS7 tephra suggests that tephra 21/10 is slightly younger than 100 ka, whereas the other two (21/4 and 21/23) are older than 100 ka. Estimates of the minimum volumes of material ejected during these eruptions make them comparable to most historical eruptive events at this volcano, and eruption 21/4 to the 1945 eruption – the most powerful eruption of the 20th century."

The purpose of the modeling was to study the features of the deep structure and compare them with a previously studied area in the central part of the basin. In addition, the depths of the upper and lower edges of magnetized objects were calculated using the tangent method. As a result of the conducted research, a structural-density section of the crust was obtained, where the block structure of the basement was revealed, the differentiation of the composition of which is associated with the formation processes. Calculation of the depth of the edges of magnetically active bodies showed that they are confined to the upper crust, localized mainly in fault zones and volcanic structures. In the central part of the section, altered continental crust with signs of basification and volcanism was revealed."

For this, we used the relative paleointensity values calculated following the technique described by Bagina-Petrova. There is no difference in the rate of magnetization fixation among studied peat samples, and the age of magnetization is comparable to the age of the peat deposits themselves. The solution to the inverse problem of magnetostratigraphy using the relative paleointensity values can be used to correlate peat sections among themselves and to estimate the rate of peat accumulation in different periods of the Holocene, even in the absence of radiocarbon dating for one of the correlated sections."

The most characteristic type of stress state for Southern Sakhalin is latitudinal–sublatitudinal horizontal compression. The field forming the morphology of the Pugachev and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcanoes, as well as the shape of their gryphons, fully corresponds to the nature of this state, which is confirmed by analysis of satellite images.The images were used to supplement the results of previous researchers on the study of directions of gryphon bands and to measure deformation of volcano calderas. The Pugachev volcano gryphon bend strikes 25°, and that of the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano strikes 30°, which corresponds well to the regional tectonic stress field. The expediency of using remote (satellite) methods as an supplement to geological and geophysical methods, in particular borehole calipers, is shown."

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerous landslides are located on the passive margin of Norway. According to their number and length of their headwalls, the margin can be divided into three segments (from south to north): Scandinavian, Barents Sea, and Svalbard. The fourth segment (Arctic) is the transition zone located north of the Svalbard archipelago. In the Scandinavian segment, on the continental slope and deeper, about 40 large underwater landslide bodies have been identified. The Barents Sea is dominated by deep-sea fan deposits, which are associated with landslides. No large landslides were found in the Svalbard segment. An analysis of published and original geological and geophysical data indicates that the most likely formation of new landslides can occur in the Svalbard segment, as well as on the Vestnesa Ridge."

The sinistral activation of these faults was induced by the regional NW-directed stress field. The analysis of fault tectonics at the prospective sites of bedrock noble metal mineralization showed that it is mainly found in the W–E-trending tension gashes subparallel to the local stress. These S-shaped tension gashes are arranged in en echelon structures, which are controlled by the conjugate set of NE-trending dextral and NW-trending sinistral faults."

Both our own materials and earlier published data were used (1 : 1 000 000–1 : 200 000): the results of processing and interpreting the digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data (SRTM-03), gravity survey, 2D seismic survey, magnetotelluric sounding, and revision mapping survey data. A 1 : 2 500 000 structure–contour map of the trough accompanied with cross-sections was constructed. The trough was formed in the Mesoproterozoic on the crystalline basement of the Aldan Shield. It extends submeridionally for 700 km varying in width between 40 and 170 km. In the south, the rift wedges out within the Aldan Shield, and in the north, it is fully overlain by Paleozoic sediments. The trough becomes deeper and wider to the north, where maximum depth to the top of the crystalline basement beneath the trough is more than 24 km. Shallow deposition environments are indicative of slow subsidence over about one billion years. Igneous complexes of the trough hosted in thick Neoproterozoic sequences are central-type ultramafic–alkali intrusions, dolerite and trachybasalt dikes and sills. More ancient igneous complexes are overlain by younger sediments. It is possible to study their composition in exposed host rocks outside the trough. The Yudoma–Maya trough is characterized by a noncoeval metallogeny. It consists of large deposits with rare-earth elements, tantalum, niobium, large stratiform complex deposits with silver and germanium, as well as copper and gold deposits."

    "abstract": "Abstract In polished thin sections of ferromanganese crust from the Alba guyot (Magellan Seamounts), nine cosmic spherules of type I were found in undisturbed occurrence. They consist of Fe oxides and sometimes contain a core of Fe–Ni alloy. The spherules are 40–250 µm in size and are confined to porous phosphate-clay material filling spaces between columns composed of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides. Phosphates in the matrix hosting the spherules are represented mainly by bone detritus. Barite grains, zeolites, and foraminifera were found. The presence of spherules in situ in the Fe–Mn crust excludes contamination during sample preparation and indicates that the spherules accumulated almost simultaneously with the host layer. Spherules from crushed crusts of the Alba and Fedorov guyots were also studied; the presence of a ferromanganese shell with a concentrically layered structure was noted in some of them."

    "abstract": "Abstract New and previously published data on the isotope-geochemical characteristics of the Upper Cretaceous and Early Paleogene complexes of the Ozernoy–Valaginsky segment of the Achaivayam–Valaginsky paleoarc are presented. It has been established that the material composition of the rocks of the Achaivayam–Valaginsky paleoarc (terrane), which form individual volcanic fields within the terrane, differs. Thus, on Karaginsky Island, volcanics of the moderate-potassium calc-alkaline and shoshonite series are widespread. On the Ozernoy Peninsula, low-potassium basalts of the tholeiitic series have predominantly developed. Among the rocks of the Kumroch Ridge, the following stand out: low-potassium basalt–andesite–basalt, medium-potassium calc-alkaline and high-potassium shoshonite series. Volcanic rocks of the Tumrok ridge are represented by low-potassium picrites and high-potassium trachybasalt–trachyandesites. On the Valaginsky Ridge, low-potassium tholeiitic, moderate-potassium calc-alkaline and shoshonite-latite series are distinguished, as well as picrites and lamproitoids. The isotopic (Sr, Nd and Pb) and geochemical composition of the rocks indicates their formation from a depleted mantle source within an ensimatic volcanic arc. It has been demonstrated that, in the absence of significant differences in the material composition of rocks, regional differences are evident. The enrichment of volcanics with large-ion lithophile elements is explained by the role of fluids introduced into the melts during melting of the suprasubduction mantle wedge. The issues of the region’s geodynamics are considered."

    "abstract": "Abstract The papers examines the evolution of the Tsukanovka River floodplain in its deltaic zone over the Little Ice Age (LIA). The chronological reference of climate events is correlated with published data. The relative warming of events is estimated by broadleaf pollen sum. There were three periods of warming (13th, 16th, and 18th centuries), a cool period (14th century), and three cold periods (15th, 17th, and 19th centuries) during the LIA in southwestern Primorye. Warming played a major role in vegetation changes, while moisture availability was crucial for the evolution of floodplain landscapes. Accumulation of floodplain sediments in the deltaic zone of the Tsukanovka River began in the end of the Medieval Warm Period–beginning of the LIA. Floods of varying magnitude and duration played a major role in sedimentation. Summer floods were driven by typhoons and tropical and extratropical cyclones. The magnitude of spring floods depended on the amount of winter precipitation. The frequency of summer precipitation increased mainly during the LIA cold phases, when an East Asian summer monsoon was active. During warming, winter precipitation increased due to weakening of the winter phase of the East Asian monsoon. The frequency of the summer storm precipitation was the highest in the 14th–15th centuries, 17th century, and late 18th century–early 19th century. The floodplain experienced significant spring floods in the late 13th century, 16th century, and in the mid-18th century. Abundant and prolonged floods and freshets were the leading factor in the formation of the lithogenic base of the floodplain landscapes."

    "abstract": "Abstract Field studies have established that methane concentrations in free, adsorbed, and dissolved gas samples of Upper Quaternary deposits and surface strams of the Pereyaslavsky graben in the Middle Amur sedimentary basin vary within the range of 0.6–19 088.4, 1.8–9.5, and 2.3–115.0 × 10 –4 %, with the totals of methane homologues, respectively, being 0.00–0.84, 0.29–5.71, and 0.01–0.20 × 10 –4 %. Calculation and interpretation of gas-geochemical indicators have made it possible to identify ten genetic groups of indigenous sources of hydrocarbon gases, including migrating gases of oil, gas, and condensate accumulations. A comprehensive interpretation of gas-geochemical and geological-geophysical data showed that the distribution of hydrocarbon gases is jointly controlled by the main factors of gas accumulation, i.e., geological structure, fold and fault tectonics, coal- and oil-bearing capacity, and bituminosity of rock complexes. A geotectonic and gas-geochemical assessment of the hydrocarbon potential of the study area was carried out."

    "title": "Late Neoarchean Continental Crust Magmatism and Jurassic Hydrothermal Activity in the Duozhuang Area of Western Shandong, China: Evidence from Zircon in Monzogranite",
    "abstract": "Abstract The composition, formation time, material sources and evolution processes of craton basements have been research hot spots in the field of earth science. Detailed research on these issues is conducive to the understanding of the early evolution processes of the earth. The basement of North China Craton (NCC), which was formed by the amalgamation of several small continental blocks, has a very large outcrop area and has attracted much attention. The region of Western Shandong, which is a typical region for the exposure of the Precambrian basement of NCC, is an ideal research base for the Precambrian history of NCC. In this paper, a monzogranite sample from the Duozhuang area of this region has been collected for LA-ICP-MS zircon U–Pb dating and trace element analysis. According to the experiment, the age of the sample is about 2508 Ma and it is a product of late Neoarchean continental crust magmatism. The sample is orogenic and its formation may have been related to continent-continent or ocean-continent collision. Thus, cratonization may have occurred as early as late Neoarchean in some regions of NCC. Besides, the lower intersection between the discordant line of the sample and the concordia curve is 172.4 Ma, which indicates that a lead loss event caused by hydrothermal activity took place in zircon of this sample at about 172.4 Ma. As a result, it can be inferred that a major craton destruction event may have occurred in this region at about 172.4 Ma."

    "title": "Enhanced West Antarctic ice loss triggered by polynya response to meridional winds",
    "abstract": "West Antarctic outlet glaciers are in a stage of rapid ice loss, modulated by wind-driven exposure to warm ocean water. Rapid ice loss probably began in the mid-twentieth century and is often attributed to warmer ocean conditions near the ice shelves driven by strengthening westerly winds at the continental shelf break. This westerly wind trend is a feature of some historical climate simulations but is not supported by proxy (for example, ice-core, tree-ring) observations. Here we present an ensemble of regional ocean simulations and proxy-constrained climate reconstructions and show that shelf-break westerlies are a poor indicator of ocean conditions near the ice shelves. Instead, cumulative northerly wind anomalies close coastal polynyas (open-water regions), driving anomalous warming and freshening near the ice shelves, increasing ice-shelf melting. The increased meltwater leads to strengthening of the undercurrent that supplies warm water, further increasing melting. Our results highlight the importance of local northerly winds and associated sea ice changes for ice-shelf melting in West Antarctica. Proxy reconstructions show a significant historical northerly wind trend in this region, providing the atmospheric forcing that can explain the initiation of West Antarctic glacier retreat in the mid-twentieth century."

    "abstract": "Abstract The article describes the Vetvistoe ore occurrence located in the Okhotsk segment of the Okhotsk–Chukotka volcanic belt. The ore field is confined to the exomorphic contactof a large Late Cretaceous granitoid intrusion and is formed by Jurassic sedimentary rocks in which garnet–pyroxene skarns with Pb–Zn mineralization are developed after intercalations of calcareous sandstones. The skarns are overlain by sericite–quartz beresites with disseminated Au–Ag–Bi–Te mineralization. Mineralization formed from initially high-temperature (600°C) and highly concentrated (29–20 wt % NaCl equiv.) gas-saturated hydrothermal solutions–brines with a predominantly CaCl and LiCl composition at their boiling, periodic dilution (up to 1 wt % equiv. NaCl), and a change in sulfur, oxygen, and tellurium fugacities and pH values. The Vetvistoe occurrence differs from “classic” Pb–Zn skarn deposits in the lesser development of carbonate rocks in the ore-bearing sequence and the overprinting of late Au–Ag–Bi–Te mineral parageneses."

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper reports U–Pb zircon age data on igneous rocks from the Vetrenskaya area (upper reaches of the Kolyma River), as well as major and trace element compositions of these rocks. Based on these data, four major pulses of magmatic activity may be distinguished (age of events in million years: ca. 170, 153–144, 95–94, and 86–82). The first two pulses were presumably related to the formation of the supra-subduction Uyandina–Yasachaya volcanic belt and the Main Batholith belt of the Kolyma region. The third and fourth pulses are likely genetically linked to the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt (OCVB). Despite the differences in age, the studied igneous rocks are generally characterized by a similar composition, which may be attributed to the melting of the same protolith. Of the total seven plutonic complexes identified within the observed area, four (the Nera-Bokhapcha, Basugun’in, Siberdik, and Kolyma complexes) are represented by intrusive bodies whose age, rock chemistry, and the position in the regional geological frame are very similar. In the light of the new data, such a detailed subdivision of the plutonic rocks looks unnecessary."

    "abstract": "Abstract Clinopyroxenites and wehrlites of the ophiolite complex of the Kamchatsky Mys Peninsula have been studied. Petro- and geochemical characteristics of the rocks were obtained and compositions of olivines, clinopyroxenes and chrome-spinels were determined. Contents of platinum group elements (PGEs) and rhenium in olivine-clinopyroxenite were analyzed. The obtained characteristics of clinopyroxenites and wehrlites of the Kamchatsky Mys Peninsula were compared with similar rocks in different complexes from other regions. Among the published data, none complex correspond the Kamchatsky Mys rocks in all the parameters. The rocks have a cumulative nature and were formed within the transitional (layered) part of the ophiolite complex. The composition of minerals from the Kamchatsky Mys rocks shows extended continuous trends, often overlapping the fields of oceanic and suprasubduction settings. The trace-element distribution in clinopyroxenites indicates an LREE-depleted N-MORB type mantle source. The high contents of Rh (1.04 ppb), Pt (13.4 ppb), and Pd (34.4 ppb) with Pd predominance and the low contents of Os (0.086 ppb), Ir (2.26 ppb) and Ru (0.24 ppb) in the clinopyroxenite indicate the fractional crystallization of the parent magma. According to the sum of the characteristics, the composition of the cumulative rocks of the Cretaceous ophiolite complex of the Kamchatsky Mys peninsula confirms the attribution of this complex to P-type (plume type) ophiolites."

    "abstract": "Abstract The study provides the first data on the quantity and distribution of stable isotopes of boron (δ 11 B) and chlorine (δ 37 Cl) in waters of the Sinegorskoe field of high pCO 2 mineral water and the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano (Sakhalin Island), in addition to chemical compositions and isotopy ( 18 O, D, and 3 H). It is shown that the investigated waters are attributed to formation waters, and variations in their chemical composition and isotope characteristics ( 3 H) are related to the water–rock–gas interaction, with the insignificant influence of atmospheric precipitation. Measurements of chlorine and boron isotopes performed for the first time allowed us to establish that waters in both cases formed as a result of interaction between water and rocks of marine genesis, with no involvement of juvenile or subduction waters, as well as volcanic gases. The source of chlorine in the waters is evaporites of Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine sedimentary strata. Clay alteration processes (illitization of smectite) are the source of boron in the water, according to the obtained δ 11 B and δ 18 O values. It may well be that marine borates are an additional source of boron in Sinegorsk mineral waters. The observed variations in isotope values of boron and, to a lesser extent, chlorine in mineral and mud volcanic waters are explained by significant differences in geological conditions of the studied objects. Based on the isotope-geochemical data, a scheme is proposed for the formation of the isotope-chemical composition of waters of the Sinegorskoe field and the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk mud volcano."

    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon is crucial for climate mitigation and agroecosystem sustainability, yet its depletion is concerning and its response to long-term fertilization remains unclear. Here we leverage the Broadbalk Classical Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), the world’s longest-running continuous winter wheat fertilization trial, along with 14 C labelling, metagenomics and metabolomics to determine how 180 years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization impact soil organic carbon dynamics. Compared with no fertilization, long-term P, N and combined NP fertilization increased the soil organic carbon content by 10%, 22% and 28%, respectively. P application alone disproportionately increased microbial respiration (37%) and biomass (20%), limiting stable carbon formation and slightly increasing labile carbon. N application alone increased microbial carbon use and necromass accumulation efficiency, increasing mineral-associated carbon build-up. Combined NP fertilization enhanced plant-derived carbon inputs and the transformation of labile carbon into stable carbon, increasing soil organic carbon quantity and stability. A meta-analysis of the effects of fertilization duration on soil organic carbon revealed that N and P fertilization globally increased cropland soil organic carbon by 21% and 13%, and these promoting effects decreased before increasing after 16 and 34 years, respectively. Overall, long-term mineral fertilization can effectively enhance soil carbon sequestration."

    "abstract": "Samples of asteroid (101955) Bennu delivered by the OSIRIS-REx mission offer the opportunity to study pristine planetary materials unchanged by exposure to the terrestrial environment. Here we use a combination of X-ray diffraction and various electron microscopy techniques to explore the detailed mineralogy of Bennu samples and determine the alteration history of the planetesimal protolith from which they originated. The samples consist largely of hydrated sheet-silicate minerals, namely nanoscale serpentine and saponite of varied grain size, which are decorated with micro- to nanoscale Fe-sulfides, magnetite and carbonates. We observe sheet silicates parallel and normal to sulfide surfaces and as inclusions in sulfides; sulfur-rich veins transecting the sheet-silicate matrix; zoned carbonates and phosphates and sulfide and magnetite grains exhibiting embayment. The mineralogical evidence indicates alteration of accreted minerals by a fluid that evolved with time, leading to etching, dissolution and reprecipitation. Sulfide compositions indicate alteration at ~25 °C, similar to conditions inferred for asteroid (162173) Ryugu and Ivuna-type (CI) chondrite meteorites. The fluid probably evolved from neutral to alkaline, culminating with the precipitation of highly soluble salts. We conclude that Bennu’s protolith comprised mainly nanometre to micrometre silicates, with fewer chondrules and calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions than those of most chondrite groups."

    "title": "Deep mantle heterogeneities formed through a basal magma ocean contaminated by core exsolution",
    "abstract": "Earth’s lowermost mantle harbours two large low-velocity provinces with patches of ultralow-velocity zones. These seismic anomalies may retain geochemical signatures distinct from the surrounding mantle. Yet, their origin remains enigmatic. One proposed explanation is the differentiation of an early-formed basal magma ocean. However, the presence of an excessively thick layer of iron-rich ferropericlase in the crystallized basal magma ocean conflicts with seismic tomography models. Here we use combined thermodynamic and geodynamic modelling to investigate the crystallization of a basal magma ocean continuously contaminated by oxide exsolved from the core, termed the basal exsolution contaminated magma ocean. We find suppression of ferropericlase crystallization. Geodynamic modelling demonstrates that the solidified contaminated magma ocean mantle can lead to the formation of deep mantle structures consistent with large low-velocity provinces and ultralow-velocity zones. In addition, diapirs of core exsolution entrained into the solid mantle may cause small-scale scattering. The basal exsolution contaminated magma ocean inherits the silicon, tungsten and helium isotope compositions from the core and exhibits trace element enrichments, suggesting its possible role as a source material for ocean island basalts that may sample the large low-velocity provinces, pointing to a unified mechanism for forming deep mantle heterogeneities."

    "abstract": "Permafrost regions contain a substantial fraction of Earth’s soil nitrogen, which is vulnerable to climate change. The response of this crucial N stock to warming could impact the permafrost–climate feedback by altering plant productivity, microbial decomposition and nitrous oxide emissions. However, the long-term trajectory of soil N stocks in response to warming remains unclear. Here we present results from a ten-year field warming experiment in a permafrost ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. We made repeated measurements of soil N stocks to 50 cm depth and assessed 28 N-cycling variables to explore three primary pathways affecting soil N stocks, including N inputs, microbial N transformations and N losses. Our results reveal that, despite no changes being observed during the initial years of the experiment, warmed plots experienced a decline in surface soil N stocks (an average 7.7% reduction relative to control plots) after eight years of warming. This decrease is associated with the enhanced N sequestration in perennial plant biomass, increased ecosystem N leaching and gaseous N losses from soils. Our findings underscore the vulnerability of soil N stocks in permafrost regions to ongoing warming, and suggest that the potential permafrost–climate feedback may be stronger than previously anticipated."

    "abstract": "The OSIRIS-REx mission deployed contact pad samplers to collect regolith from the uppermost surface of the asteroid Bennu that was exposed to the space environment. Space weathering processes, dominated by micrometeoroid impacts and solar irradiation, modify the mineralogy and chemistry of exposed surfaces to produce solar wind-amorphized layers on clays, metallic whiskers associated with high temperature melts and Fe nitride created by the reaction of indigenous N-bearing gases with space-weathered surfaces. Here, we use cosmogenic noble gases and radionuclides to suggest that the upper metre of Bennu’s regolith has been exposed to cosmic rays for 2–7 million years, consistent with remote sensing observations indicating that the asteroid’s surface is dynamic and regularly modified by mass movement. Solar energetic particle track and microcrater densities constrain the space weathering spectral changes observed in Hokioi crater to <50,000 years. These spectral changes are driven largely by the accumulation of impact melt deposits on particle surfaces, although compositional or grain size effects may also occur. Comparison of Bennu samples with those collected from the asteroids Ryugu and Itokawa suggest that micrometeoroid impacts might play a more active and rapid role in the space weathering of asteroidal surfaces than was initially suggested, particularly for carbonaceous bodies."

    "title": "Geodynamics of a global plate reorganization from topological data analysis",
    "abstract": "Earth’s lithosphere is fragmented into tectonic plates that move relative to each other and the mantle, following a dynamic equilibrium that evolves over time. Sporadically, abrupt kinematic changes occur that typically lead to regional-scale plate reconfigurations, and hypothetically to global-scale events, affecting the motion of all major plates. Identifying and understanding such global plate reorganizations has proven challenging because of the geometric nature of plate tectonic theory and the scarcity of preserved kinematic changes. Here we combine Earth-like global mantle convection with topological data analysis to show that global plate reorganization events can emerge from mantle–lithosphere interactions. Unlike regional changes, during these rare global events, the entire plate network shifts to a new dynamic equilibrium by the formation and destruction of plate boundaries at global scale, affecting the dynamics of the entire mantle. Such events represent transitions between two stable states in the coupled mantle–plates system. Our findings suggest that Earth may have experienced a similar global tectonic reorganization during the mid-Eocene around 47 million years ago. Our new approach provides a quantitative framework to unveil mantle–lithosphere interactions from global geodynamic models."

    "title": "Carbon drawdown by algal blooms during Antarctic Cold Reversal from sedimentary ancient DNA",
    "abstract": "The Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in the global carbon budget. One key interval for understanding this role is the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,700–12,700 calibrated (cal) yr bp )—a Southern Hemisphere-specific cooling event that temporarily reversed the deglacial trend of warming and rising atmospheric CO 2 . Modelling studies propose that the atmospheric CO 2 plateau during the Antarctic Cold Reversal is related to increased marine productivity. However, proxy constraints on the primary producer community are limited to the subset of groups that leave a fossil record. Here we applied ancient DNA shotgun metagenomics to samples from a marine sediment core to characterize the composition of the marine ecosystem across all trophic levels, finding that the haptophyte algae Phaeocystis antarctica was the dominant primary producer during the event. Independent proxy evidence from the same record points to high productivity in response to enhanced sea-ice seasonality caused by the cooling. Post Antarctic Cold Reversal, abrupt Phaeocystis community loss shows how sensitive this ecosystem is to warming, potentially representing a key tipping element. As an analogy for present warming, it highlights the importance of regions with high seasonal sea-ice variability and Phaeocystis dominance, such as the Ross Sea, in stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 content."

    "title": "Earth’s silicate weathering continuum",
    "abstract": "Chemical weathering of silicate rocks redistributes major, minor and trace elements through coupled dissolution–precipitation reactions. These weathering processes drive shifts in ocean acid–base chemistry, modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and providing a stabilizing feedback in the carbon cycle. Silicate weathering occurs in both terrestrial and marine environments, releasing (‘forward’) or consuming alkalinity (‘reverse’), but these have largely been perceived as independent and studied in isolation. However, weathering products are transported downstream across terrestrial and to marine environments, suggesting a dynamic coupling of these weathering processes across scales. Here we propose that the Earth’s silicate weathering occurs along a continuum linking mountains to the deepest sedimentary environments and forward to reverse weathering. In this framework, the magnitude and direction of a local weathering flux depends on the materials’ origin, weathering–erosion history and environmental conditions. Consequently, global silicate weathering fluxes and the long-term carbon cycle feedback may be governed by the dynamic interplay of various environments along the silicate weathering continuum."

    "title": "Seismic evidence for oceanic plate delamination offshore Southwest Iberia",
    "abstract": "Subduction of oceanic lithosphere and delamination of continental lithosphere constitute the two predominant mechanisms by which the Earth’s surface is recycled into the mantle. Continental plate delamination typically occurs in collisional orogens by the separation of the lithospheric mantle from the overlying lighter crust, aided by weak layers within continental lithosphere. By contrast, oceanic lithosphere is generally considered to be sufficiently rigid to inhibit delamination. Here we show from seismic imaging and numerical simulations that delamination of oceanic lithosphere is occurring offshore Southwest Iberia. Specifically, seismic tomography reveals a high-velocity anomaly that we interpret as a delaminating block of old oceanic lithosphere, a process that we reproduce with numerical simulations. We propose that this process was triggered by plate convergence and assisted by a thick serpentinized layer that allows the lithospheric mantle to decouple from the overlying crust. We suggest that such oceanic delamination may facilitate subduction initiation, a long-unsolved problem in the theory of plate tectonics, and may be responsible for some of the highest-magnitude earthquakes in Europe, including the M8.5–8.7 Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the M7.9 San Vincente Earthquake of 1969."

    "title": "Interseismic secondary zone of subsidence during earthquake cycles in subduction zones",
    "abstract": "Surface deformation observed in subduction zone forearcs helps to determine the locking state of the megathrust beneath, and therefore seismic and tsunami hazards. The vertical component of such deformation is particularly important, but measurements of this component in various subduction zones show a level of complexity that is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate from numerical simulations and a global compilation of observations that this apparent complexity can be readily explained in terms of earthquake cycles in a viscoelastic Earth. We show that subduction zones follow a common process of earthquake cycle evolution but are currently at various stages of this cycle, and that, during interseismic deformation, there is a previously overlooked secondary zone of subsidence around the volcanic arc, in addition to the primary zone of subsidence near the trench. We propose that this secondary zone is a key signature of megathrust locking that is absent from the elastic models commonly used to infer the locking state. The importance of this signature is demonstrated by the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, where we argue that the ongoing subsidence of the island arc is strong evidence for the presence of such a secondary zone; this implies that the megathrust is locked and building energy for a future earthquake, contrary to the prevailing understanding."

    "title": "Global response of floods to tropical explosive volcanic eruptions",
    "abstract": "Tropical volcanic eruptions with a high volcanic explosivity index (≥5) impact the global climate system, but little is known about how they affect floods. Here, leveraging global climate model simulations with volcanic forcings and statistical relationships between seasonal climate drivers and peak discharge, we investigate the response of seasonal peak discharges at 7,886 streamgauges worldwide to three tropical explosive volcanic eruptions in the twentieth century: Agung 1963 (Indonesia), Santa Maria 1902 (Guatemala) and Pinatubo 1991 (Philippines), whose stratospheric aerosol plumes were distributed primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and symmetrically across both hemispheres, respectively. For the eruptions with interhemispherically asymmetric aerosol distributions, tropical regions show more immediate and widespread responses to the eruptions than non-tropical regions, with a distinct interhemispheric contrast of decreasing (increasing) peak discharges in the hemisphere in which the eruption happened (did not happen). For the case of symmetric aerosol distribution, tropical (arid) regions have the strongest tendency to respond to the eruption by decreasing (increasing) peak discharges in both hemispheres. These regional flood responses are attributed mainly to seasonal precipitation changes across the climate regions. Beyond direct volcanic hazards, our study provides a global view of the secondary flood hazards resulting from hydroclimatic changes induced by large explosive eruptions."

    "abstract": "A complete series of calcite-rhodochrosite solid solutions [(Ca 1-x Mn x )CO 3 ] are prepared, and their dissolution processes in various water samples are experimentally investigated. The crystal morphologies of the solid solutions vary from blocky spherical crystal aggregates to smaller spheres with an increasing incorporation of Mn in the solids. Regarding dissolution in N 2 -degassed water, air-saturated water and CO 2 -saturated water at 25 °C, the aqueous Ca and Mn concentrations reach their highest values after 1240–2400 h, 6–12 h and < 1 h, respectively, and then decrease gradually to a steady state; additionally, the ion activity products (log_IAP) at the final steady state (≈ solubility products in log_ K sp ) are estimated to be − 8.46 ± 0.06, − 8.44 ± 0.10 and − 8.59 ± 0.10 for calcite [CaCO 3 ], respectively, and − 10.25 ± 0.08, − 10.26 ± 0.10 and − 10.28 ± 0.03, for rhodochrosite [MnCO 3 ], respectively. As X Mn increases, the log_IAP values decrease from − 8.44 ~ − 8.59 for calcite to − 10.25 ~ − 10.28 for rhodochrosite. The aqueous Mn concentrations increase with an increasing Mn/(Ca + Mn) molar ratio (X Mn ) of the (Ca 1-x Mn x )CO 3 solid solutions, while the aqueous Ca concentrations show the highest values at X Mn = 0.53–0.63. In the constructed Lippmann diagram of subregular (Ca 1-x Mn x )CO 3 solid solutions, the solids dissolve incongruently, and the data points of the aqueous solutions move progressively up to the Lippmann solutus curve and then along the solutus curve or saturation curve of pure MnCO 3 to the Mn-poor side. The microcrystalline cores of the spherical crystal aggregates are preferentially dissolved to form core hollows while simultaneously precipitating Mn-rich hexagonal prisms."

    "title": "Natural speciation of nickel at the micrometer scale in serpentine (ultramafic) topsoils using microfocused X-ray fluorescence, diffraction, and absorption",
    "abstract": "Serpentine soils and ultramafic laterites develop over ultramafic bedrock and are important geological materials from environmental, geochemical, and industrial standpoints. They have naturally elevated concentrations of trace metals, such as Ni, Cr, and Co, and also high levels of Fe and Mg. Minerals host these trace metals and influence metal mobility. Ni in particular is an important trace metal in these soils, and the objective of this research was to use microscale (µ) techniques to identify naturally occurring minerals that contain Ni and Ni correlations with other trace metals, such as Fe, Mn, and Cr. Synchrotron based µ-XRF, µ-XRD, and µ-XAS were used. Ni was often located in the octahedral layer of serpentine minerals, such as lizardite, and in other layered phyllosilicate minerals with similar octahedral structure, such as chlorite group minerals including clinochlore and chamosite. Ni was also present in goethite, hematite, magnetite, and ferrihydrite. Goethite was present with lizardite and antigorite on the micrometer scale. Lizardite integrated both Ni and Mn simultaneously in its octahedral layer. Enstatite, pargasite, chamosite, phlogopite, and forsterite incorporated various amounts of Ni and Fe over the micrometer spatial scale. Ni content increased six to seven times within the same 500 µm µ-XRD transect on chamosite and phlogopite. Data are shown down to an 8 µm spatial scale. Ni was not associated with chromite or zincochromite particles. Ni often correlated with Fe and Mn, and generally did not correlate with Cr, Zn, Ca, or K in µ-XRF maps. A split shoulder feature in the µ-XAS data at 8400 eV (3.7 Å −1 in k-space) is highly correlated (94% of averaged LCF results) to Ni located in the octahedral sheet of layered phyllosilicate minerals, such as serpentine and chlorite-group minerals. A comparison of bulk-XAS LCF to averaged µ-XAS LCF results showed good representation of the bulk soil via the µ-XAS technique for two of the three soils. In the locations analyzed by µ-XAS, average Ni speciation was dominated by layered phyllosilicate and serpentine minerals (76%), iron oxides (18%), and manganese oxides (9%). In the locations analyzed by µ-XRD, average Ni speciation was dominated by layered phyllosilicate, serpentine, and ultramafic-related minerals (71%) and iron oxides (17%), illustrating the complementary nature of these two methods."

    "title": "Reductive dissolution of As(V)-bearing Fe(III)-precipitates formed by Fe(II) oxidation in aqueous solutions",
    "abstract": "Iron(III)-precipitates formed by the oxidation of dissolved Fe(II) are important sorbents for major and trace elements in aquatic and terrestrial systems. Their reductive dissolution in turn may result in the release of associated elements. We examined the reductive dissolution kinetics of an environmentally relevant set of Fe(II)-derived arsenate-containing Fe(III)-precipitates whose structure as function of phosphate (P) and silicate (Si) content varied between poorly-crystalline lepidocrocite, amorphous Fe(III)-phosphate, and Si-containing ferrihydrite. The experiments were performed with 0.2–0.5 mM precipitate-Fe(III) using 10 mM Na-ascorbate as reductant, 5 mM bipyridine as Fe(II)-complexing ligand, and 10 mM MOPS/5 mM NaOH as pH 7.0 buffer. Times required for the dissolution of half of the precipitate (t 50% ) ranged from 1.5 to 39 h; spanning a factor 25 range. At loadings up to ~ 0.2 P/Fe (molar ratio), phosphate decreased the t 50% of Si-free precipitates, probably by reducing the crystallinity of lepidocrocite. The reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-phosphates formed at higher P/Fe ratios was again slower, possibly due to P-inhibited ascorbate binding to precipitate-Fe(III). The slowest reductive dissolution was observed for P-free Si-ferrihydrite with ~ 0.1 Si/Fe, suggesting that silicate binding and polymerization may reduce surface accessibility. The inhibiting effect of Si was reduced by phosphate. Dried-resuspended precipitates dissolved 1.0 to 1.8-times more slowly than precipitates that were kept wet after synthesis, most probably because drying enhanced nanoparticle aggregation. Variations in the reductive dissolution kinetics of Fe(II) oxidation products as reported from this study should be taken into account when addressing the impact of such precipitates on the environmental cycling of co-transformed nutrients and contaminants."

    "abstract": "Green rust (GR) is a potentially important compound for the reduction of heavy metal and organic pollutants in subsurface environment because of its high Fe(II) content, but many details of the actual reaction mechanism are lacking. The reductive capacity distribution within GR is a key to understand how and where the redox reaction occurs and computational chemistry can provide more details about the electronic properties of green rust. We constructed three sizes of cluster models of single layer GR (i.e., without interlayer molecules or ions) and calculated the charge distribution of these structures using density functional theory. We found that the Fe(II) and Fe(III) are distributed unevenly in the single layer GR. Within a certain range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratios, the outer iron atoms behave more like Fe(III) and the inner iron atoms behave more like Fe(II). These findings indicate that the interior of GR is more reductive than the outer parts and will provide new information to understand the GR redox interactions."

    "title": "Sulfate-based coagulants can suppress methanogenesis in treated oil sands fine tailings",
    "abstract": "Bitumen extraction from mined oil sands ore generates a large volume of fluid fines tailings (FFT) that must be incorporated into either aquatic or terrestrial reclamation landforms. Mine operators are developing various tailings technologies to accelerate FFT dewatering, including the addition of chemical coagulants and flocculants. However, the impacts of these coagulants and flocculants on biogeochemical processes in treated FFT are not fully understood. We conducted anaerobic batch experiments to examine the influence of different doses (i.e., 0, 500, 1000, and 1500 ppm) of sulfate-based coagulants, including aluminum sulfate (alum) [Al 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ∙ n H 2 O], ferric sulfate (ferric) [Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 ∙ n H 2 O], and calcium sulfate (gypsum) [CaSO 4 ∙2H 2 O], on biogenic gas production and microbial communities in treated FFT. Our results show that sulfate addition stimulated microbial sulfate reduction, which inhibited methanogenesis in coagulated FFT relative to experimental controls. Sulfate depletion preceded increased methane production in the 500 ppm gypsum experiment, while larger ferric and alum doses produced higher sulfate concentrations and larger pH decreases. 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that Comamonadaceae , Anaerolineaceae , and Desulfocapsaceae were the major bacterial families, while Methanoregulaceae and Methanosaetaceae dominated the archaeal families in all treatments. Precipitation of iron(II) sulfides limited dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentrations in experiments where Fe availability was not limited. Our results indicate that addition of sulfate-based coagulants can stimulate microbial sulfate reduction and suppress methanogenesis. However, resumption of methane production following sulfate depletion reveals complex interactions among biogeochemical reaction pathways. Overall, this study demonstrates that biogeochemical cycling of carbon, sulfur, and iron are important considerations for the development and implementation of tailings treatment technologies."

    "title": "Major ion chemistry and suitability of groundwater resources for different utilizations in mica mining areas, Jharkhand, India",
    "abstract": "Groundwater resources in mica mining areas of Jharkhand are vital for local communities, agriculture, and domestic utilization. The study investigates the major ion chemistry of groundwater in the mica mining regions, focusing on key physicochemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and concentrations of major cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺) and anions (HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, F − ). Groundwater samples from the study area were collected before the monsoon season, during the monsoon season, and after the monsoon season. The hydro-chemical analysis reveals that groundwater in the mica mining zones exhibits elevated levels of dissolved ions, with NO₃⁻, F − , Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and total hardness exceeding permissible limits set by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for drinking purposes at some locations. Water Quality Index (WQI) assessments suggest that a significant proportion of groundwater samples fall into the “good” to “very good” category for drinking and about 29% of the samples fall under the “poor” category. The groundwater was generally suitable for irrigational use with exception of a few due to high salinity. The principal component analysis revealed rock weathering as a dominant source of ions along with anthropogenic sources like mining and agriculture contributing minorly to the ionic load. The predominant hydro-chemical facies identified were Ca-Mg-HCO 3 and Ca-Mg-Cl-SO 4 types. Both carbonate and silicate weathering play an important role in the geochemical signature of the groundwater in the area. The study implicates the potential health impacts of using the groundwater as drinking water without treatment at a few locations owing to high fluoride, nitrate and dissolved solids. The study also highlights the need for sustainable water management practices and regular monitoring of groundwater quality to mitigate the anthropogenic impacts on groundwater resources."

    "title": "Effect of Mn2+ concentration on the growth of δ-MnO2 crystals under acidic conditions",
    "abstract": "δ-MnO 2 is an important component of environmental minerals and is among the strongest sorbents and oxidants. The crystalline morphology of δ-MnO 2 is one of the key factors affecting its reactivity. In this work, δ-MnO 2 was initially synthesized and placed in an acidic environment to react with Mn 2+ and undergo a crystalline transformation. During the transformation of crystalline δ-MnO 2 , kinetic sampling was conducted, followed by analyses of the structures and morphologies of the samples. The results showed that at pH 2.5 and 4, δ-MnO 2 nanoflakes spontaneously self-assembled into nanoribbons via edge-to-edge assembly in the initial stage. Subsequently, these nanoribbons attached to each other to form primary nanorods through a face-to-face assembly along the c -axis. These primary nanorods then assembled along the (001) planes and lateral surfaces, achieving further growth and thickening. Since a lower pH is more favorable for the formation of vacancies in δ-MnO 2 , δ-MnO 2 can rapidly adsorb Mn 2+ directly onto the vacancies to form tunnel walls. At the same time, the rapid formation of the tunnel walls leads to a quick establishment of hydrogen bonding between adjacent nanoribbons, enabling the assembly of these nanoribbons into primary nanorods. Therefore, in a solution with the same concentration of Mn 2+ , the structure transformation and morphology evolution of δ-MnO 2 to α-MnO 2 occur faster at pH 2.5 than at pH 4. These findings provide insights into the mechanism for crystal growth from layer-based to tunnel-based nanorods and methods for efficient and controlled syntheses of nanomaterials."

    "abstract": "Humic acids are amphiphilic species whose behavior in aqueous solution suggests that they form pseudomicelles–aggregates akin to the micelles familiar from synthetic surfactant chemistry. It is thought that humic pseudomicelles can be formed by both intramolecular coiling and intermolecular association, depending on the molecular weight, structural characteristics, and polydispersity of the humic acid in question. The process does not feature a critical micelle concentration. Experimental evidence indicates that metal ions enhance the detergent character of dissolved humic acid by facilitating the coiling and folding of the polymer chains. A recently conceived alternative model suggests that humic acids consist of relatively small subunits that associate through weak molecular interactions. This view appears to run counter to certain experimental observations, but deserves careful attention. The strong association between metal ions and solid humic acid makes it possible to use an inexpensive commercial grade for the decontamination of polluted water. A continuous elution process through a column packed with humic acid allows for the removal of both heavy metals and organic xenobiotics from aqueous solution."

    "title": "Element mobility during basalt-water-CO2 interaction: observations in natural systems vs. laboratory experiments and implication for carbon storage",
    "abstract": "Today, carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere is the most ambitious challenge to mitigate climate changes. Basalt rocks are abundant on the Earth’s surface (≈ 10%) and very abundant in the ocean floors and subaerial environments. Glassy matrix and minerals constituting these rocks contain metals (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Fe 2+ ) that can react with carbonic acid to form metal carbonates (CaCO 3 , MgO 3 and FeCO3). Here, we present a data compilation of the chemical composition of waters circulating in basalt aquifers worldwide and the results of simple basalt-water-CO 2 experiments. Induced or naturally occurring weathering of basalts rocks release elements in waters and elemental concentration is closely dependent on water CO 2 concentration (and hence on water pH). We also performed two series of experiments where basaltic rock powder interacts with CO 2 -charged waters for one month at room temperature. Laboratory experiments evidenced that in the first stages of water-rock interaction, the high content of CO 2 dissolved in water accelerates the basalt weathering process, releasing in the water not only elements that can form carbonate minerals but also other elements, which depending on their concentration can be essential or toxic for life. Relative mobility of elements such as Fe and Al, together with rare earth elements, increases at low pH conditions, while it decreases notably at neutral pH conditions. The comparison between experimental findings and natural evidence allowed to better understand the geochemical processes in basaltic aquifers hosted in active and inactive volcanic systems and to discuss these findings in light of the potential environmental impact of CO 2 storage in mafic and ultramafic rocks."

    "abstract": "Microbiological weathering of coarse residue deposit (CRD) kimberlite produced by the Venetia Diamond Mine, Limpopo, South Africa enhanced mineral carbonation relative to untreated material. Cultures of photosynthetically enriched biofilm produced maximal carbonation conditions when mixed with kimberlite and incubated under near surface conditions. Interestingly, mineral carbonation also occurred in the dark, under water-saturated conditions. The examination of mineralized biofilms in ca. 150 µm-thick-sections using light microscopy, X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) and backscatter electron—scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry demonstrated that microbiological weathering aided in producing secondary calcium/magnesium carbonates on silicate grain boundaries. Calcium/magnesium sulphate(s) precipitated under vadose conditions demonstrating that evaporites formed upon drying. In this system, mineral carbonation was only observed in regions possessing bacteria, preserved within carbonate as cemented microcolonies. 16S rDNA molecular diversity of bacteria in kimberlite and in natural biofilms growing on kimberlite were dominated by Proteobacteria that are active in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur cycling. Cyanobacteria based enrichment cultures provided with nitrogen & phosphorus (nutrients) to enhance growth, possessed increased diversity of bacteria, with Proteobacteria re-establishing themselves as the dominant bacterial lineage when incubated under dark, vadose conditions consistent with natural kimberlite. Overall, 16S rDNA analyses revealed that weathered kimberlite hosts a diverse microbiome consistent with soils, metal cycling and hydrocarbon degradation. Enhanced weathering and carbonate-cemented microcolonies demonstrate that microorganisms are key to mineral carbonation of kimberlite."

Optimization directly affects the accuracy of some parameters, such as the average bond length, molecular volume, harmonic vibrational frequency, and other thermodynamic parameters. Here, we used the improved volume variable cluster model (VVCM) method to optimize the molecular clusters of a typical oxide, quartz. We documented the average bond length and relative volume change. Finally, we extracted the harmonic vibrational frequencies and calculated the equilibrium fractionation factor of the silicon and oxygen isotopes. Given its performance in geometrical optimization and isotope fractionation factor calculation, we further applied the improved VVCM method to calculate isotope equilibrium fractionation factors of Cd and Zn between the hydroxide (Zn–Al layered double hydroxide), carbonate (cadmium-containing calcite) and their aqueous solutions under superficial conditions. We summarized a detailed procedure and used it to re-evaluate published theoretical results for cadmium-containing hydroxyapatite, emphasizing the relative volume change for all clusters and confirming the optimal point charge arrangement (PCA). The results showed that the average bond length and isotope fractionation factor are consistent with those published in previous studies, and the relative volume changes are considerably lower than the results calculated using the periodic boundary method. Specifically, the average Si–O bond length of quartz was 1.63 Å, and the relative volume change of quartz centered on silicon atoms was − 0.39%. The average Zn–O bond length in the Zn–Al-layered double hydroxide was 2.10 Å, with a relative volume change of 1.96%. Cadmium-containing calcite had an average Cd–O bond length of 2.28 Å, with a relative volume change of 0.45%. At 298 K, the equilibrium fractionation factors between quartz, Zn–Al-layered double hydroxide, cadmium-containing calcite, and their corresponding aqueous solutions were \\(\\Delta ^{30/28} {\\text{Si}}_{{{\\text{Qtz-H}}_{4} {\\text{SiO}}_{4} }} = 2.20{\\permil} \\) , \\(\\Delta^{18/16} {\\text{O}}_{ {\\text{Qtz}}{-} ( {\\text{H}}_{2} {\\text{O}} )_{\\text{n}}} = 36.05{\\permil}\\) , \\(\\Delta^{66/64} {\\text{Zn}}_{ {\\text{Zn}} {-} {\\text{Al LDH-Zn}} ( {\\text{H}}_{2} {\\text{O}} )_{\\text{n}}^{2+}} = 1.12{\\permil}\\) and \\(\\Delta^{114/110} {\\text{Cd}}_{ {\\text{(Cd--Cal)-Cd}} ( {\\text{H}}_{2} {\\text{O}} )_ {\\text{n}}^{2 +} } = - 0.26{\\permil}\\) respectively. These results strongly support the reliability of the improved VVCM method for geometric optimization of molecular clusters."

    "title": "Dissolution and solubility of the calcium-nickel carbonate solid solutions [(Ca1−xNix)CO3] at 25 °C",
    "abstract": "A series of the calcium-nickel carbonate solid solutions [(Ca 1−x Ni x )CO 3 ] were synthesized and their dissolution in N 2 -degassed water (NDW) and CO 2 -saturated water (CSW) at 25 °C was experimentally investigated. During dissolution of the synthetic solids (Ni-bearing calcite, amorphous Ca-bearing NiCO 3 and their mixtures), the Ni-calcite and the Ca-NiCO 3 dissolved first followed by the formation of the Ni-bearing aragonite-structure phases. After 240–300 days of dissolution in NDW, the water solutions achieved the stable Ca and Ni concentrations of 0.592–0.665 and 0.073–0.290 mmol/L for the solids with lower Ni/(Ca + Ni) mol ratios (X Ni ), or 0.608–0.721 and 0.273–0.430 mmol/L for the solids with higher X Ni , respectively. After 240–300 days of dissolution in CSW, the water solutions achieved the stable Ca and Ni concentrations of 1.094–3.738 and 0.831–4.300 mmol/L, respectively. For dissolution in NDW and CSW, the mean values of log IAP (Ion activity products) in the final stable state (≈ log K sp , Solubility product constants) were determined to be − 8.65 ± 0.04 and − 8.16 ± 0.11 for calcite [CaCO 3 ], respectively; − 8.50 ± 0.02 and − 7.69 ± 0.03 for the synthetical nickel carbonates [NiCO 3 ], respectively. In respect to the bulk composition of the (Ca 1−x Ni x )CO 3 solid solutions, the final log IAP showed the highest value when X Ni = 0.10–0.30. Mostly, the mean values of log IAP increased with the increasing X Ni in respect to the Ni-calcite, the Ni-aragonite and the amorphous Ca-Ni carbonate. The plotting of the experimental data on the Lippmann diagram for the (Ca 1−x Ni x )CO 3 solid solution using the predicted Guggenheim parameters of a 0 = 2.14 and a 1 = − 0.128 from a miscibility gap of X Ni = 0.238 to 0.690 indicated that the solids dissolved incongruently and the final Ca and Ni concentrations in the water solutions were simultaneously limited by the minimum stoichiometric saturation curves for the Ni-calcite, Ni-aragonite and the amorphous Ca-Ni carbonate. During dissolution in NDW, the Ni 2+ preferred to dissolve into the water solution and Ca 2+ preferred to remain in the solid, while during dissolution in CSW for the solids with higher X Ni , the Ca 2+ preferred to dissolve into the water solution and Ni 2+ preferred to remain in the solid. These findings provide valuable insights into understanding the mechanisms governing Ni geochemical cycle in natural environments."

    "abstract": "Solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been widely applied to analyze the speciation of soil organic P; however, this time-consuming technique suffers from a low analytical efficiency, because of the lack of fundamental information such as the spin–lattice relaxation ( T 1 ) of 31 P nucleus for model P compounds. In this study, we for the first time determined the T 1 values of twelve typical soil organic P compounds using the inversion recovery method. Furthermore, we examined the effect of co-existing paramagnetic ions (e.g., Fe 3+ and Mn 2+ ) on the reduction of the T 1 values of these compounds. Without the addition of paramagnetic ions, the T 1 values of twelve model P compounds ranged from 0.61 s for phytic acid to 9.65 s for orthophosphate. In contrast, the presence of paramagnetic ion significantly shortened the T 1 values of orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, and phytic acid to 1.29, 1.26, and 0.07 s, respectively, except that of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) remaining unchanged. Additionally, we evaluated the feasibility of improving the efficiency of quantitative 31 P NMR analysis via addition of paramagnetic ion. Results show that, after an addition of 50 mg L −1 paramagnetic ions, 31 P NMR measurement can be 3 times more efficient, attributed to the reduced T 1 and the corresponding recycle delay."

    "title": "Prebiotic thiol-catalyzed thioamide bond formation",
    "abstract": "Thioamide bonds are important intermediates in prebiotic chemistry. In cyanosulfidic prebiotic chemistry, they serve as crucial intermediates in the pathways that lead to the formation of many important biomolecules (e.g., amino acids). They can also serve as purine and pyrimidine precursors, the two classes of heterocycle employed in genetic molecules. Despite their importance, the formation of thioamide bonds from nitriles under prebiotic conditions has required large excesses of sulfide or compounds with unknown prebiotic sources. Here, we describe the thiol-catalyzed formation of thioamide bonds from nitriles. We show that the formation of the simplest of these compounds, thioformamide, forms readily in spark-discharge experiments from hydrogen cyanide, sulfide, and a methanethiol catalyst, suggesting potential accumulation on early Earth. Lastly, we demonstrate that thioformamide has a Gibbs energy of hydrolysis ( \\(\\Delta G^{\\circ }_r\\) ) comparable to other energy-currencies on early Earth such as pyrophosphate and thioester bonds. Overall, our findings imply that thioamides might have been abundant on early Earth and served a variety of functions during chemical evolution."

    "title": "Characterization, dissolution and solubility of synthetic cadmium hydroxylapatite [Cd5(PO4)3OH] at 25–45°C",
    "abstract": "Background The substitution of Ca 2+ in Ca-hydroxylapatite by toxic Cd 2+ can cause the forming of Cd-hydroxylapatite and is a significant issue in a great variety of research areas, which hence needs an understanding of the essential physicochemical characteristics. Unfortunately, the solubility product and thermodynamic data for Cd-hydroxylapatite in water under a variety of conditions now are lacking. Little information has been reported by previous researchers. Additionally, the dissolution mechanism of Cd-hydroxylapatite has never been studied. Results Dissolution of the synthetic cadmium hydroxylapatite [Cd-HAP, Cd 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH] in HNO 3 solution (pH = 2), ultrapure water (pH = 5.6) and NaOH solution (pH = 9) was experimentally studied at 25, 35 and 45°C. Characterization by XRD, FT-IR and FE-SEM proved that Cd-HAP solids showed no recognizable change during dissolution. For the Cd-HAP dissolution in aqueous acidic media at initial pH 2 and 25°C, the solution cadmium and phosphate concentrations increased rapidly and reached the peak values after 20–30 days and 10 days reaction, respectively. Thereafter, the Cd-HAP dissolution rate decreased slowly, whereas the solution Cd/P molar ratio increased constantly from 1.65–1.69 to 6.61–6.76. The mean K sp values for Cd 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH were determined to be 10 −64.62 (10 −64.53 –10 −64.71 ) at 25°C, 10 −65.58 (10 −65.31 –10 −65.80 ) at 35°C and 10 −66.57 (10 −66.24 –10 −66.90 ) at 45°C. Based on the obtained solubility data from the dissolution at initial pH 2 and 25°C, the Gibbs free energy of Cd 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH forming \\(\\Delta G_{f}^{o}\\) was determined to be −3,970.47 kJ/mol (−3,969.92 to −3,970.96 kJ/mol). Thermodynamic parameters, Δ G 0 , Δ H 0 , Δ S 0 , and \\(\\Delta C_{\\text{p}}^{ 0}\\) for the dissolution process of Cd-HAP in aqueous acidic media at initial pH 2 and 25°C were calculated 368,710.12 J/K mol, −158,809.54 J/mol, −1,770.20 and −869.53 J/K mol, respectively. Conclusions Based on the experimental results of the present work and some previous researches, the cadmium hydroxylapatite (Cd-HAP) dissolution in aqueous media is considered to have the following coincident processes: the stoichiometric dissolution coupled with protonation and complexation reactions, the non-stoichiometric dissolution with Cd 2+ release and PO 4 3− sorption and the sorption of Cd 2+ and PO 4 3− species from solution backwards onto Cd-HAP surface. The obtained solubility products ( K sp ) 10 −64.62 (10 −64.53 –10 −64.71 ) for Cd-HAP was approximately 7.62–5.62 log units lower than 10 −57 –10 −59 for calcium hydroxylapatite (Ca-HAP).

    "title": "The formation of spinel-group minerals in contaminated soils: the sequestration of metal(loid)s by unexpected incidental nanoparticles",
    "abstract": "Mineralogical studies of contaminated soils affected by smelter emission and dust from mining activities indicate that minerals of the spinel group are one of the common hosts of metal-bearing contaminants. Spinel group minerals typically originate from high temperature processes, but an increasing number of studies indicate that metal-bearing spinel group minerals can also form under ambient Earth surface conditions in surficial soils. In this contribution to honor Donald Sparks, we show that the spinels Zn-bearing magnetite (Zn 0.5 Fe 2.5 O 4 ) and minium (Pb 3 O 4 ) form during low temperature alteration of Pb-bearing silica glass in surficial organic rich soils in proximity to a former Cu-smelter in Timmins, Ontario, Canada. The glass most likely formed during high-temperature processes and has been either emitted by the smelter or wind-blown from waste rock piles to near-by soils. The alteration of the glass by percolating pore solutions has resulted in the formation of large micrometer-size dendritic etch features and in nanometer-size dendritic alteration halos composed of nano-size prismatic crystals of Zn-rich magnetite and spherical nanoparticles of minium. Both spinel-type phases are embedded in an amorphous silica matrix which formed during the alteration of the glass at low temperature. A review on the occurrence of spinel-group minerals in smelter-affected soils or mine tailings indicates that the formation of these minerals under ambient Earth surface conditions is quite common and often results in the sequestration of contaminants such as Cu, Ni, Zn and Sb. The pedogenic spinels often occur as euhedral crystals in nano-size mineral assemblages within alteration features such as dendritic etch patterns, mineral surface coatings and mineralized organic matter. Their well-developed crystal forms indicate that (a) they have not formed during a rapid cooling process in a smelter or refinery which typically creates spherical particulate matter, and (b) they have not been part of particulate matter added via fluvial or Aeolian processes which most commonly yield anhedral morphologies. The formation of nano-size spinel-group minerals in low temperature environmental settings may lead to the long-term storage of metal(loid)s in mineral phases and their transport over vast distances via fluvial, alluvial and Aeolian processes."

    "title": "Adsorption of copper (II) on mesoporous silica: the effect of nano-scale confinement",
    "abstract": "Nano-scale spatial confinement can alter chemistry at mineral–water interfaces. These nano-scale confinement effects can lead to anomalous fate and transport behavior of aqueous metal species. When a fluid resides in a nanoporous environments (pore size under 100 nm), the observed density, surface tension, and dielectric constant diverge from those measured in the bulk. To evaluate the impact of nano-scale confinement on the adsorption of copper (Cu 2+ ), we performed batch adsorption studies using mesoporous silica. Mesoporous silica with the narrow distribution of pore diameters (SBA-15; 8, 6, and 4 nm pore diameters) was chosen since the silanol functional groups are typical to surface environments. Batch adsorption isotherms were fit with adsorption models (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin–Radushkevich) and adsorption kinetic data were fit to a pseudo-first-order reaction model. We found that with decreasing pore size, the maximum surface area-normalized uptake of Cu 2+ increased. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model demonstrates that the adsorption is faster as the pore size decreases from 8 to 4 nm. We attribute these effects to the deviations in fundamental water properties as pore diameter decreases. In particular, these effects are most notable in SBA-15 with a 4-nm pore where the changes in water properties may be responsible for the enhanced Cu mobility, and therefore, faster Cu adsorption kinetics."

    "title": "Geochemical dispersion of gold-bearing quartz veins in the Wadi Abu Khusheiba area in Southern Jordan",
    "abstract": "This study delves into the geochemical dispersion of gold-bearing quartz veins in the Wadi Abu Khusheiba area, southern Jordan, with a focus on uncovering the complex patterns of mineralization and their geological significance. Employing an in-depth geochemical analysis of 24 rock samples from the region, we identified that these samples are predominantly hosted by oversaturated rhyolitic rocks, characterized by high SiO 2 content and abundant free Quartz and orthoclase minerals. The mineralized zone of the quartz veins is particularly notable for its gold and silver concentrations, with maximum values reaching up to 5 ppm for gold and 18 ppm for silver. Our investigation into the elemental correlations revealed nuanced relationships, dependent on the 21 sample and analyzed at confidence level of (85%). Contrary to initial assumptions, we did not find a significant positive correlation between gold (Au) and arsenic (As), nor significant negative correlations between gold and other trace elements. These insights are critical for understanding the geochemical behavior of gold in the area and offer a nuanced view of elemental associations. The results of this study are significant for both academic research and practical exploration. They enhance our comprehension of the geological history and mineralization processes in Wadi Abu Khusheiba, providing valuable data that can inform future exploration strategies and deepen our understanding of mineral deposition in similar geological settings. This research not only contributes to the scientific community’s knowledge of the area’s geochemistry but also has potential implications for the mining and exploration industries."

    "title": "Silicate coprecipitation reduces green rust crystal size and limits dissolution-precipitation during air oxidation",
    "abstract": "Green rusts (GR) are mixed-valence iron (Fe) hydroxides which form in reducing redox environments like riparian and wetland soils and shallow groundwater. In these environments, silicon (Si) can influence Fe oxides’ chemical and physical properties but its role in GR formation and subsequent oxidative transformation have not been studied starting at initial nucleation. Green rust sulfate [GR(SO 4 )] and green rust carbonate [GR(CO 3 )] were both coprecipitated from salts by base titration in increasing % mol Si (0, 1, 10, and 50). The minerals were characterized before and after rapid (24 h) aqueous air-oxidation by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fe extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and N 2 -BET surface area. Results showed that only GR(SO4) or GR(CO3) was formed at every tested Si concentration. Increasing % mol Si caused decreased plate size and increased surface area in GR(CO3) but not GR(SO4). GR plate basal thickness was not changed at any condition indicating a lack of Si interlayering. Air oxidation of GR(SO4) at all % mol Si contents transformed by dissolution and reprecipitation into lepidocrocite and goethite, favoring ferrihydrite with higher % Si content. Air oxidation of GR(CO3) transformed into magnetite and goethite but increasing Si caused GR to oxidize while retaining its hexagonal plate structure via solid-state oxidation. Our results indicate that Si has the potential to cause GR to form in smaller particles and upon air oxidation, Si can either stabilize the plate structure or alter transformation to ferrihydrite.

    "title": "Review of interactions between phosphorus and arsenic in soils from four case studies",
    "abstract": "Arsenic is a non-essential element that poses risks in many environments, including soil, groundwater, and surface water. Insights into the environmental biogeochemistry of As can be gained by comparing As and P reaction processes. Arsenic and P are chemical analogues, and it is proposed that they have similar chemical behaviors in environmental systems. However some chemical properties of As and P are distinct, such as redox reactions, causing the biogeochemical behavior of the two elements to differ. In the environment, As occurs as either As(V) or As(III) oxyanions (e.g., AsO 4 3− or AsO 3 3− ). In contrast, P occurs predominantly as oxidation state five plus; most commonly as the orthophosphate ion (PO 4 3− ). In this paper, data from four published case studies are presented with a focus on P and As distribution and speciation in soil. The goal is show how analyzing P chemistry in soils can provide greater insights into As reaction processes in soils. The case studies discussed include: (1) soil developed from shale parent material, (2) mine-waste impacted wetland soils, (3) phosphate-amended contaminated soil, and (4) plants grown in biochar-amended, mine-contaminated soil. Data show that while P and As have competitive reactions in soils, in most natural systems they have distinct biogeochemical processes that create differing mobility and bioavailability. These processes include redox reactions and rhizosphere processes that affect As bioavailability. Results from these case studies are used as examples to illustrate how studying P and As together allows for enhanced interpretation of As biogeochemical processes in soils."

    "title": "Onboard experiment investigating metal leaching of fresh hydrothermal sulfide cores into seawater",
    "abstract": "We observed the initial release rate of metals from four fresh (i.e., without long time exposure to the atmosphere) hydrothermal sulfide cores into artificial seawater. The sulfide samples were collected by seafloor drilling from the Okinawa Trough by D/V Chikyu , powdered under inert gas, and immediately subjected to onboard metal-leaching experiments at different temperatures (5 °C and 20 °C), and under different redox conditions (oxic and anoxic), for 1–30 h. Zinc and Pb were preferentially released from sulfide samples containing various metals (i.e., Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) into seawater. Under oxic experimental conditions, Zn and Pb dissolution rates from two sulfide samples composed mainly of iron disulfide minerals (pyrite and marcasite) were higher than those from two other sulfide samples with abundant sphalerite, galena, and/or silicate minerals. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the high metal-releasing sample contained several galvanic couples of iron disulfide with other sulfide minerals, whereas the low metal-releasing sample contained fewer galvanic couples or were coated by a silicate mineral. The experiments overall confirmed that the galvanic effects with iron disulfide minerals greatly induce the initial release of Zn and Pb from hydrothermal sulfides into seawater, especially under warm oxic conditions."

    "abstract": "Bardawil Lake is a unique aquatic ecosystem that provides a habitat for various fish and other marine organisms. This study aimed to analyze the quality of fish species to prove that this lake is free of pollution, not other Egyptian lakes, due to the accumulation of some heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in various tissues of fish species that were caught from this lake. Thirty-five fish samples were caught during the Spring of 2018 from seven different species: Mugil cephalus, Liza auratus, Sparus aurata, Dicentrarchus labrax, Siganus rivulatus, Anguilla angilla, and Solae solea . The Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods using a spectrophotometer determined the biochemical composition. In contrast, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was employed to determine the heavy metals expressed by µg/g wet weight. Results exposed that the accumulation of essential micronutrient (Cu, Zn) content was higher than toxic elements (Cd & Pb) in muscles in order to Zn > Cu > Pb > Cd. Muscles < gills < liver in order of all metals except Pb with order muscles < liver < gills. The metals studied in the muscles were lower than those set by the WHO and the EU standards. The carcinogenic risk with lower allowable limits of 1 × 10 –6 to 1 × 10 –4 in both normal and high consumption groups; target and total target hazard quotients (THQ & HI) in muscles were < 1. The biochemical composition level was highest in the liver, except for protein, which was highest in muscle for all fish species. There is no evidence of harmful contaminants in the muscular tissue of the fish sampled from Bardawil Lake, although fishing activity. However, customers should know that health concerns may be associated with overeating fish."

    "title": "Effects of metal cation substitution on hexavalent chromium reduction by green rust",
    "abstract": "Chromium contamination is a serious environmental issue in areas affected by leather tanning and metal plating, and green rust sulfate has been tested extensively as a potential material for in situ chemical reduction of hexavalent chromium in groundwater. Reported products and mechanisms for the reaction have varied, most likely because of green rust’s layered structure, as reduction at outer and interlayer surfaces might produce different reaction products with variable stabilities. Based on studies of Cr(III) oxidation by biogenic Mn (IV) oxides, Cr mobility in oxic soils is controlled by the solubility of the Cr(III)-bearing phase. Therefore, careful engineering of green rust properties, i.e., crystal/particle size, morphology, structure, and electron availability, is essential for its optimization as a remediation reagent. In the present study, pure green rust sulfate and green rust sulfate with Al, Mg and Zn substitutions were synthesized and reacted with identical chromate (CrO 4 2− ) solutions. The reaction products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, pair distribution function analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy and treated with synthetic δ-MnO 2 to assess how easily Cr(III) in the products could be oxidized. It was found that Mg substitution had the most beneficial effect on Cr lability in the product. Less than 2.5% of the Cr(III) present in the reacted Mg-GR was reoxidized by δ-MnO 2 within 14 days, and the particle structure and Cr speciation observed during X-ray scattering and absorption analyses of this product suggested that Cr(VI) was reduced in its interlayer. Reduction in the interlayer lead to the linkage of newly-formed Cr(III) to hydroxyl groups in the adjacent octahedral layers, which resulted in increased structural coherency between these layers, distinctive rim domains, sequestration of Cr(III) in insoluble Fe oxide bonding environments resistant to reoxidation and partial transformation to Cr(III)-substituted feroxyhyte. Based on the results of this study of hexavalent chromium reduction by green rust sulfate and other studies, further improvements can also be made to this remediation technique by reacting chromate with a large excess of green rust sulfate, which provides excess Fe(II) that can catalyze transformation to more crystalline iron oxides, and synthesis of the reactant under alkaline conditions, which has been shown to favor chromium reduction in the interlayer of Fe(II)-bearing phyllosilicates."

    "title": "Health and ecological risk assessment of metals in surface water from the Himalayan tributaries of the Ganga river, India",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the trace element concentrations in the surface waters of four north-joining Himalayan tributaries of the Ganga river (Ramganga, Ghaghara, Gandak, and Kosi), highlighting the combined effects of geogenic processes and anthropogenic activities on trace element chemistry and water quality. A knowledge gap exists in understanding the sources of trace elements in these tributaries and the contribution of trace elements from these tributaries to the Gangariver. The novelty of the study lies in its assessment of sources, human health risks, and ecological impacts. The investigation was conducted by assessing trace element concentrations and comparing them with national and international standards. Various human health and ecological risk indicators, including the Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI), Hazard Quotient (HQ), Health Index (HI), Chronic Daily Intake (CDI), and the Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI), were applied. The results reveal high concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) in the Ramganga, indicating contamination from industrial activities in the catchment. Although most trace element concentrations are within safe limits, Pb concentration in the Ramganga exceeds the limit prescribed by WHO. The Ramganga shows the highest health risks, with a HI total of 1.876 for adults and 1.616 for children. In contrast, the Ghaghara, Gandak, and Kosi exhibit lower but moderate contamination levels. HPI values for these rivers- 93.74 for the Ghaghara, 83.95 for the Kosi, 83.13 for the Gandak, and 80.43 for the Ramganga—indicate that although contamination is below critical thresholds, targeted mitigation strategies are needed. The findings provide valuable insights into trace metal sources and their implications for human health and ecological risks, and emphasize the need for frequent monitoring and pollution control measures for maintaining sustainable water quality in these tributaries."

    "title": "Phosphorus retention in calcareous soils and the effect of organic matter on its mobility",
    "abstract": "A survey of the interactions between phosphorus (P) species and the components of calcareous soils shows that both surface reactions and precipitation take place, especially in the presence of calcite and limestone. The principal products of these reactions are dicalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate, which may interconvert after formation. The role of calcium carbonate in P retention by calcareous soils is, however, significant only at relatively high P concentrations – non-carbonate clays play a more important part at lower concentrations. In the presence of iron oxide particles, occlusion of P frequently occurs in these bodies, especially with forms of the element that are pedogenic in origin. Progressive mineralization and immobilization, often biological in nature, are generally observed when P is added as a fertilizer. Manure serves both as a source of subsurface P and an effective mobilizing agent. Blockage of P sorption sites by organic acids, as well as complexation of exchangeable Al and Fe in the soil, are potential causes of this mobilization. Swine and chicken manure are especially rich P sources, largely due the practice of adding the element to the feed of nonruminants. Humic materials, both native and added, appear to increase recovery of Olsen P. In the presence of metal cations, strong complexes between inorganic P and humates are formed. The influence of humic soil amendments on P mobility warrants further investigation."

    "title": "Constraining the carbonate system in soils via testing the internal consistency of pH, pCO2 and alkalinity measurements",
    "abstract": "Inorganic carbon exists in various dissolved, gaseous and solid phase forms in natural waters and soils. It is important to accurately measure and model these forms to understand system responses to global climate change. The carbonate system can, in theory, be fully constrained and modelled by measuring at least two out of the following four parameters: partial pressure (pCO 2 ), total alkalinity (TA), pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) but this has not been demonstrated in soils. In this study, this “internal consistency” of the soil carbonate system was examined by predicting pH of soil extracts from laboratory measurement of TA through alkalinity titration for solutions in which pCO 2 was fixed through equilibrating the soil solution with air with a known pCO 2 . This predicted pH (pH CO2 ) was compared with pH measured on the same soil extracts using spectrophotometric and glass electrode methods (pH spec and pH elec ). Discrepancy between measured and calculated pH was within 0.00–0.1 pH unit for most samples. However, more deviation was observed for those sample with low alkalinity (≤ 0.5 meq L −1 ). This is likely attributable to an effect of dissolved organic matter, which can contribute alkalinity not considered in the thermodynamic carbonate model calculations; further research is required to resolve this problem. The effects of increasing soil pCO 2 was modelled to illustrate how internally consistent models can be used to predict risks of pH declines and carbonate mineral dissolution in some soils."

    "title": "Hydrothermal alteration processes in monzogranite: a case study from the Eastern Desert of Egypt: implications from remote sensing, geochemistry and mineralogy",
    "abstract": "The South Eastern Desert (SED) of Egypt is one of the most promising areas in Egypt; it is widely explored for exploring the rare earth elements (REEs) and uranium-bearing ores. It is a main part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS). Therefore, the present study concerns with Sikait-Nugrus area as one of the most prolific sites in this region. The study provides a detailed geological, structural, and mineralogical investigation of the monzogranites to describe and characterize the various alteration types and sequence. For this purpose, remote sensing, geochemical and petrographical techniques were applied. The remote sensing technique helped in constructing a detailed geologic map of the study area to follow up strictly the alteration zone of the Sikait-Nugrus area. Petrographically, the granites predominates in the study area, they are described as slightly and highly altered monzogranites. The slightly altered one is composed mainly of quartz (~ 20–35%), alkali feldspar (~ 25–30%), plagioclase (~ 25–30%), and mica (~ 5–15%), while accessory minerals are represented by zircon and monazite. On the other hand, the portion of this granite close to the shearing zone is intensively altered and characterized by sericitization as the main alteration processes. This sheared portion is characterized by accessory minerals as, uranothorite, allanite, fluorite and Nb-minerals (ishikawaite). Minerlogically, the altered monzogranites are predominated by the following mineral groups: (1) radioactive minerals as uranyl silicates (soddyite, uranophane and kasolite), and thorium minerals (thorite and uranothorite), (2) Nb–Ta minerals (betafite, plumbobetafite, columbite, fergusonite, and aeschynite), (3) REE minerals (monazite, cheralite and xenotime), and (4) zircon and fluorite as accessory minerals. Geochemically, the recorded pattern of the REEs tetrad effect (M-type) for the highly altered samples indicate that these granites are highly evolved and affected by late stage of hydrothermal alteration and the effective water-rich alteration processes that connected to intensive physico-chemical changes. The total REE concentrations equal 241.8 and 249.75 ppm for the highly and slightly altered samples. A significant mass change (MC) was analyzed by the isocon technique (22.95 & 11.11) and volume change (VC) (1.8 &-7.99) for the highly and slightly altered samples, respectively. The mass balance calculations and the isocon diagrams revealed that some major oxides were removed from the slightly altered monzogranites and transformed later into highly altered monzogranites with increasing the alteration intensity due to the impacts of hydrothermal alteration processes. The studied area is virgin, where no detailed studies have been applied to this region. It is extendable to other parts of the Arabian-Nubian Shield in around the Red Sea in Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The applied technical workflow is also extendible to other surface analogues everywhere."

    "title": "Investigation of hydrochemical characteristic, water quality and associated health risks of metals and metalloids in water resources in the vicinity of Akamkpa quarry district, southeastern, Nigeria",
    "abstract": "Quarrying of rock aggregates generates produced water that, if not handled properly will be a source of pollution for nearby water bodies, thus affecting the chemistry of the water. This study examined the chemistry, impact of quarrying activities on water resources and the health consequences/risks posed by ingestion of the water by humans in the Akamkpa quarry region in southeastern Nigeria. Thirty (30) water samples consisting of pond water, stream water, hand dug wells, and borehole samples were collected and analyzed for their physicochemical parameters using standard methods. The results obtained from the analyses indicated that the water was moderately acidic, fresh, and not salty, with many parameters below the recommended standards with Ca 2+ , and HCO 3 − being the dominant ions present in the water resources. Rock weathering processes including silicate weathering as illustrated by hydrochemical facies, cross plots, and Gibbs diagrams are the dominant mechanisms influencing the quality and major ions chemistry of the water resources with minor contributions from dissolution, anthropogenic activities, and ion exchange. Ca-Mg-SO 4 -Cl and Na–K-HCO 3 − are the most important water types. Although the water quality index shows that the water is suitable for human use and irrigation, the mean values of As, Cd, Pb, and Se are above the acceptable limits. Additionally, the calculated contamination factor revealed the water resources are moderate to highly contaminated by As, Cd, Cr, Mo, Pb, Sb, and Se, and are therefore unsuitable for consumption with regards to these parameters. However, the residual sodium carbonate and water hazard index (WHI) values showed that 38% to 90% of sites in the quarry area were unsuitable for cultivation, 10–30% were in the low to medium impact category, and 60% were classified as risky and are from high to very high impact category. A non-cancer study of inhabitants living in the vicinity of the quarry area indicated that 6.7% of the sites have values greater than one, indicating that it may endanger the health of the people. Therefore, constant monitoring of the water quality is recommended as long-term use of contaminated water can harm humans, plants, and soils."

    "title": "Trace element partitioning between pyrochlore, microlite, fersmite and silicate melts",
    "abstract": "We present experimentally determined trace element partition coefficients (D) between pyrochlore-group minerals (Ca 2 (Nb,Ta) 2 O 6 (O,F)), Ca fersmite (CaNb 2 O 6 ), and silicate melts. Our data indicate that pyrochlores and fersmite are able to strongly fractionate trace elements during the evolution of SiO 2 -undersaturated magmas. Pyrochlore efficiently fractionates Zr and Hf from Nb and Ta, with D Zr and D Hf below or equal to unity, and D Nb and D Ta significantly above unity. We find that D Ta pyrochlore-group mineral/silicate melt is always higher than D Nb , which agrees with the HFSE partitioning of all other Ti–rich minerals such as perovskite, rutile, ilmenite or Fe-Ti spinel. Our experimental partition coefficients also show that, under oxidizing conditions, D Th is higher than corresponding D U and this implies that pyrochlore-group minerals may fractionate U and Th in silicate magmas. The rare earth element (REE) partition coefficients are around unity, only the light REE are compatible in pyrochlore-group minerals, which explains the high rare earth element concentrations in naturally occurring magmatic pyrochlores."

    "title": "Effect of Ni2+, Zn2+, and Co2+ on green rust transformation to magnetite",
    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Co 2+ mineralogical incorporation and its effect on green rust transformation to magnetite. Mineral transformation experiments were conducted by heating green rust suspensions at 85 °C in the presence of Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ , or Co 2+ under strict anoxic conditions. Transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction showed the conversion of hexagonal green rust platelets to fine grained cubic magnetite crystals. The addition of Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Co 2+ resulted in faster rates of mineral transformation. The conversion of green rust to magnetite was concurrent to significant increases in metal uptake, demonstrating a strong affinity for metal sorption/co-precipitation by magnetite. Dissolution ratio curves showed that Ni 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Co 2+ cations were incorporated into the mineral structure during magnetite crystal growth. The results indicate that the transformation of green rust to magnetite is accelerated by metal impurities, and that magnetite is a highly effective scavenger of trace metals during mineral transformation. The implications for using diagenetic magnetite from green rust precursors as paleo-proxies of Precambrian ocean chemistry are discussed. Graphical Abstract"

    "title": "Water quality assessment of Upper Ganga and Yamuna river systems during COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown: imprints of river rejuvenation",
    "abstract": "Clean river water is an essential and life-sustaining asset for all living organisms. The upper Ganga and Yamuna river system has shown signs of rejuvenation and tremendous improvement in the water quality following the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. All the industrial and commercial activity was shut down, and there was negligible wastewater discharge from the industries. This article addresses the water quality assessment from the study area, which is based on the original data of physical parameters, major and trace elements, and stable isotopes (hydrogen and oxygen) systematics during the nationwide lockdown. The impact of the lockdown could be seen in terms of an increase in dissolved oxygen (DO). Water samples were collected from the Upper Ganga and Yamuna river basins (Alaknanda, Bhagirathi, and Tons rivers) during an eight-week lockdown in Uttarakhand, India. We discussed the signs of rejuvenation of riverine based on physical parameters, major ions, trace elements, isotopic ratios, and water pollution index (WPI). Results reveal that the water quality of the entire upper basins of the Ganga has significantly improved by 93%, reflecting the signs of self-rejuvenation of the rivers. Multivariate analysis suggests a negative factor loading for an anthropogenic element ( \\({NO}_{3}^{-}\\) ), implying that they contribute little to the river water during the lockdown. Further, bicarbonate ( \\({HCO}_{3}^{-}\\) ) is a dominant element in both river basins. The geochemical facies are mainly characterized by the ( \\({{Ca}^{2+} :{Mg}^{2+} : HCO}_{3}^{-}\\) ) type of water, suggesting that silicate rock weathering dominates with little influence from carbonate weathering in the area. The positive factor loadings of some cations, like \\({HCO}_{3}^{-}\\) , \\({Ca}^{2+}\\) , and \\({Mg}^{2+}\\) reflect their strong association with the source of origin in the lockdown phases. Stable isotopic reveals that the glaciated region contributed the most to the river basin, as evidenced by the low d-excess in riverine water compared to anthropogenic contributions. Rivers can self-rejuvenate if issues of human influence and anthropogenic activities are adequately resolved and underline our responsibility for purifying the ecosystem. We observed that this improvement in the river water quality will take a shorter time, and quality will deteriorate again when commercial and industrial activity resumes."

    "title": "Discrimination of topsoil environments in a karst landscape: an outcome of a geochemical mapping campaign",
    "abstract": "The study presented in this work emerged as a result of a multiyear regional geochemical survey based on low-density topsoil sampling and the ensuing geochemical atlas of Croatia. This study focuses on the Dinaric part of Croatia to expound the underlying mechanisms controlling the mobilities and variations in distribution of potentially harmful elements as observed from different environmental angles. Although serious environmental degradation of the vulnerable karst soil landscapes was expected to occur chiefly through the accumulation of various heavy metals, the most acute threat materialized through the soil acidification (Al-toxicity) affecting the entire Dinaric karst area. This picture surfaced from the analysis of all three investigated discriminant function models employing the abovementioned environmental criteria selected autonomously with respect to the evaluated soil geochemistry, namely, geologic setting, regional placement and land use. These models are presented by not only the characteristic discriminant-function diagrams but also a set of appropriate mathematically derived geochemical maps disclosing the allocations of potential threats to the karst soil landscapes posed by soil acidity."

    "title": "Acid mine drainage biogeochemistry at Iron Mountain, California",
    "abstract": "The Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain, Shasta County, California, USA provides an excellent opportunity to study the chemical and biological controls on acid mine drainage (AMD) generation in situ , and to identify key factors controlling solution chemistry. Here we integrate four years of field-based geochemical data with 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and rRNA probe-based studies of microbial population structure, cultivation-based metabolic experiments, arsenopyrite surface colonization experiments, and results of intermediate sulfur species kinetics experiments to describe the Richmond Mine AMD system. Extremely acidic effluent (pH between 0.5 and 0.9) resulting from oxidation of approximately 1 × 10 5 to 2 × 10 5 moles pyrite/day contains up to 24 g/1 Fe, several g/1 Zn and hundreds of mg/l Cu. Geochemical conditions change markedly over time, and are reflected in changes in microbial populations. Molecular analyses of 232 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequences from six sites during a sampling time when lower temperature (<32°C), higher pH (>0.8) conditions predominated show the dominance of Fe-oxidizing prokaryotes such as Ferroplasma and Leptospirillum in the primary drainage communities. Leptospirillum group III accounts for the majority of Leptospirillum sequences, which we attribute to anomalous physical and geochemical regimes at that time. A couple of sites peripheral to the main drainage, \"Red Pool\" and a pyrite \"Slump,\" were even higher in pH (>1) and the community compositions reflected this change in geochemical conditions. Several novel lineages were identified within the archaeal Thermoplasmatales order associated with the pyrite slump, and the Red Pool (pH 1.4) contained the only population of Acidithiobacillus . Relatively small populations of Sulfobacillus spp. and Acidithiobacillus caldus may metabolize elemental sulfur as an intermediate species in the oxidation of pyritic sulfide to sulfate. Experiments show that elemental sulfur which forms on pyrite surfaces is resistant to most oxidants; its solublization by unattached cells may indicate involvement of a microbially derived electron shuttle. The detachment of thiosulfate (S 2 O 3 2- ) as a leaving group in pyrite oxidation should result in the formation and persistence of tetrathionate in low pH ferric iron-rich AMD solutions. However, tetrathionate is not observed. Although a S 2 O 3 2- -like species may form as a surface-bound intermediate, data suggest that Fe 3+ oxidizes the majority of sulfur to sulfate on the surface of pyrite. This may explain why microorganisms that can utilize intermediate sulfur species are scarce compared to Fe-oxidizing taxa at the Richmond Mine site."

    "title": "Development of the Arabian-Nubian Shield along the Marsa Alam-Idfu transect, Central-Eastern Desert, Egypt: geochemical implementation of zircon U-Pb geochronology",
    "abstract": "The magmatic complex along the Marsa Alam-Idfu transect, Central-Eastern Desert of Egypt, represents the northern segment of the Arabian–Nubian Shield (ANS), which developed within the framework of the East African Orogen. The basement rocks of the Arabian-Nubian Shield have been developed through three distinct phases of magmatic activity: the island-arc, the syn-orogenic, and the post-orogenic phases. Transitioning of the magmatic phases from the syn-orogenic to the post-orogenic, identifies changing the tectonic regime from a compressional to an extensional setting. The scarcity of comprehensive regional geochronological data that rely on precise isochron methods, such as the zircon U-Pb technique, could limit the comprehensive understanding of this region’s geological and tectonic history. That would raise a number of uncertainties ranging from the timing of the different magmatic activities and timing of changes in the tectonic regime to the existence of the pre-Pan-African crust in the CED. Our study provides new insights into the aforementioned uncertainties through zircon U-Pb dating of different rock units along the Marsa Alam-Idfu transect, CED, Egypt. The resulting ages ranged from 729 ± 3 Ma to 570 ± 2 Ma, constraining the temporal evolution of the ANS in the studied region into (1) the island-arc phase, represented by a metamorphic sample with an age of 729 ± 3 Ma. (2) the syn-orogenic phase, represented by calc-alkaline and alkaline granitic samples with ages ranging from 699 ± 4 Ma to 646 ± 2 Ma. These two phases indicate initiation of the compressional subduction regime in the CED since 729 ± 3 Ma and being dominated till 646 ± 2 Ma. (3) the post-orogenic phase, represented by metavolcanics, volcanic rocks, and alkaline plutonic samples with ages ranging from 623 ± 3 Ma to 570 ± 2 Ma. This phase suggests dominance of the compressional-to-extensional tectonic transition setting from 623 ± 3 Ma to 600 ± 1 Ma along with the Dokhan volcanism and activation of post-collision tensional regime activated at 582 ± 3 Ma. Our findings discourage the proposed dominance of the island-arc and syn-orogenic phases in the CED and the classical restriction of older magmatic activity to calc-alkaline granitic rocks and younger magmatic activity to alkaline granitic rocks. Additionally, we identified evidence of local magmatic sources by dating five grains with Mesoproterozoic (pre-Arabian–Nubian Shield) xenocrysts with ages ranging from 1549 ± 4 to 1095 ± 25 Ma."

    "title": "Probing atomic-scale processes at the ferrihydrite-water interface with reactive molecular dynamics",
    "abstract": "Interfacial processes involving metal (oxyhydr)oxide phases are important for the mobility and bioavailability of nutrients and contaminants in soils, sediments, and water. Consequently, these processes influence ecosystem health and functioning, and have shaped the biological and environmental co-evolution of Earth over geologic time. Here we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations, supported by synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy to study the molecular-scale interfacial processes that influence surface complexation in ferrihydrite-water systems containing aqueous \\({\\text {MoO}_4}^{2-}\\) . We validate the utility of this approach by calculating surface complexation models directly from simulations. The reactive force-field captures the realistic dynamics of surface restructuring, surface charge equilibration, and the evolution of the interfacial water hydrogen bond network in response to adsorption and proton transfer. We find that upon hydration and adsorption, ferrihydrite restructures into a more disordered phase through surface charge equilibration, as revealed by simulations and high-resolution X-ray diffraction. We observed how this restructuring leads to a different interfacial hydrogen bond network compared to bulk water by monitoring water dynamics. Using umbrella sampling, we constructed the free energy landscape of aqueous \\({\\text {MoO}_4}^{2-}\\) adsorption at various concentrations and the deprotonation of the ferrihydrite surface. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with the values reported by experimental surface complexation models. These findings are important as reactive molecular dynamics opens new avenues to study mineral-water interfaces, enriching and refining surface complexation models beyond their foundational assumptions.

    "title": "Eu(III) and Am(III) adsorption on aluminum (hydr)oxide minerals: surface complexation modeling",
    "abstract": "Americium is a highly radioactive actinide element found in used nuclear fuel. Its adsorption on aluminum (hydr)oxide minerals is important to study for at least two reasons: (i) aluminum (hydr)oxide minerals are ubiquitous in the subsurface environment and (ii) bentonite clays, which are proposed engineered barriers for the geologic disposal of used nuclear fuel, have the same ≡AlOH sites as aluminum (hydr)oxide minerals. Surface complexation modeling is widely used to interpret the adsorption behavior of heavy metals on mineral surfaces. While americium sorption is understudied, multiple adsorption studies for europium, a chemical analog, are available. In this study we compiled data describing Eu(III) adsorption on three aluminum (hydr)oxide minerals—corundum (α-Al 2 O 3 ), γ-alumina (γ-Al 2 O 3 ) and gibbsite (γ-Al(OH) 3 )—and developed surface complexation models for Eu(III) adsorption on these minerals by employing diffuse double layer (DDL) and charge distribution multisite complexation (CD-MUSIC) electrostatic frameworks. We also developed surface complexation models for Am(III) adsorption on corundum (α-Al 2 O 3 ) and γ-alumina (γ-Al 2 O 3 ) by employing a limited number of Am(III) adsorption data sourced from literature. For corundum and γ-alumina, two different adsorbed Eu(III) species, one each for strong and weak sites, were found to be important regardless of which electrostatic framework was used. The formation constant of the weak site species was almost 10,000 times weaker than the formation constant for the corresponding strong site species. For gibbsite, two different adsorbed Eu(III) species formed on the single available site type and were important for the DDL model, whereas the best-fit CD-MUSIC model for Eu(III)-gibbsite system required only one Eu(III) surface species. The Am(III)-corundum model based on the CD-MUSIC framework had the same set of surface species as the Eu(III)-corundum model. However, the log K values of the surface reactions were different. The best-fit Am(III)-corundum model based on the DDL framework had only one site type. Both the CD-MUSIC and the DDL model developed for Am(III)-γ-alumina system only comprised of one site type and the formation constant of the corresponding surface species was ~ 500 times stronger and ~ 700 times weaker than the corresponding Eu(III) species on the weak and the strong sites, respectively. The CD-MUSIC model for corundum and both the DDL and the CD-MUSIC models for γ-alumina predicted the Am(III) adsorption data very well, whereas the DDL model for corundum overpredicted the Am(III) adsorption data. The root mean square of errors of the DDL and CD-MUSIC models developed in this study were smaller than those of two previously-published models describing Am(III)-γ-alumina system, indicating the better predictive capacity of our models. Overall, our results suggest that using Eu(III) as an analog for Am(III) is practical approach for predicting Am(III) adsorption onto well-characterized minerals. Graphical Abstract"

    "abstract": "The present research work aims to understand the geochemistry of groundwater resources of the Yamuna—Hindon interfluve region of Bagpat district, Western Uttar Pradesh, India. The region is a part of Indo-Gangetic belt, one of the world's most fertile and intensely farmed areas. To investigate the geochemical processes governing groundwater quality, a total of 105 groundwater samples were collected during pre-monsoon season and analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters, namely, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solid (TDS), total hardness (TH), turbidity, major anions (HCO 3 − , SO 4 2− , F − , Cl − , NO 3 − ) , cations (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + , K + ) following the methods outlined in the American Public Health Association (APHA). The dissolved heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni, As, Se, Co, Cd and Al) in groundwater were analyzed by ICP-MS following the instrument manual. The analysis results revealed that the groundwater is pre-dominantly neutral to mildly alkaline in nature. The major cation chemistry majorly followed the occurrence pattern of Na + > Mg 2+ > Ca 2+ > K + , while for anions it was HCO 3 − > Cl − > SO 4 2− > NO 3 − > F − . The data plotted on Piper triangular diagram indicated that Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ -HCO 3 − and Na + -K + -HCO 3 − -Cl − were major hydrogeochemical facies. Weathering of rock-forming minerals mainly governed the groundwater geochemistry in this region, although part of the cations associated with Cl − , F − and NO 3 − may originate from anthropogenic sources. TDS, TH, turbidity and F − were identified as the major parameters that violated the prescribed limits for drinking water. Most of the heavy metals were found within the drinking water prescribed limits except for Fe, Mn, Al and Se. Elevated salinity, %Na, and magnesium hazard (MH) at certain sites limit its suitability for agricultural use. The assessment of selected organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides in five samples indicated presence of lindane, β-endosulfan and DDT isomers in few samples. However, a detailed investigation of possible pesticide contamination in this intensive agriculture area is required before drawing any final conclusions."

    "title": "Transformation and fate of Fe(III) in petroleum-hydrocarbon-contaminated soil and groundwater",
    "abstract": "In anoxic subsurface environments, low Fe(III) bioaccessibility greatly limits in situ biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs). Ferric ammonium citrate is a soluble compound that has the potential to increase the bioaccessibility of Fe(III). However, in neutral to alkaline environments, Fe(III) hydrolysis can produce Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides that may subsequently transform or recrystallize to relatively stable and less bioaccessible phases. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to elucidate the transformation and fate of Fe(III) contributed by ferric ammonium citrate in a gasoline-contaminated subsurface environment that was undergoing in situ bioremediation. Ferric ammonium citrate, together with sodium tripolyphosphate, magnesium sulphate, and nitric acid, was continuously injected into the contaminated groundwater for about 22 weeks. Colloids in the groundwater (solid particles retained on a 0.45 \\(\\upmu\\) m filter) and soil cores were collected from the site. Fe speciation in these samples was characterized using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The groundwater colloids (GWCs) contained mostly octahedrally coordinated Fe(III), but the subsoils contained both octahedrally coordinated Fe(III) and Fe(II). The fraction of Fe(II) in the subsoils generally increased after about 22 weeks of continuous amendment injection. Ferric ammonium citrate did not persist in the PHC-contaminated subsurface: the Fe(III) it contained was transformed to solid phases. Fe(III)-organic-matter (Fe(III)-OM) complex/coprecipitate and sulfate green rust were the major phases present in the GWCs; akaganeite, chloride green rust, vivianite, ferrihydrite, Fe(III)-silicate, and magnetite were present as minor phases. The subsoils contained three major phases: Fe(III)-OM complex/coprecipitate, magnetite, and calcium ferric silicate. The presence of major Fe(II) phases in the subsoils strongly indicate that secondary Fe(III) phases (especially Fe(III)-OM complex/coprecipitate) served as terminal electron acceptors during the microbial degradation of PHCs in the contaminated subsurface."

    "title": "Development of a kinetic-thermodynamic model for lime-stabilization of Na-bentonite",
    "abstract": "This study presents the first kinetic model to predict the solid and pore solution composition of Na-bentonite clay reacting with slaked lime over a period of 720 days. The model successfully accounts for most experimental data using a single kinetic rate constant. The following sequence of reactions was predicted by the model: initial rapid dissolution of portlandite within the first 7 days, leading to a decrease in pH and dissolved calcium, and concurrent formation of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H: jennite), calcium aluminate hydrate (C-A-H: C₄AH₁₃), calcium aluminosilicate hydrates (stratlingite) and hydrotalcite. After 7 days, jennite and stratlingite are predicted to transform into tobermorite-II, contributing to strength development up to 28 days. From 28 to 90 days, continued montmorillonite dissolution is predicted, along with minor formation of ettringite, partial tobermorite-II dissolution, and precipitation of secondary phases such as albite and talc. Experimentally, portlandite dissolution was confirmed by TGA and XRD and found to be complete within 7 days, in agreement with model predictions. However, other predicted solid-phase transformations (e.g., tobermorite-II formation and dissolution, ettringite, albite, and talc formation) could not be conclusively verified through experimental techniques. Aqueous phase measurements confirmed that the pH and Ca trends in solution, and that equilibrium was reached by 90 days."

    "title": "Geochemistry and microbiology of tropical serpentine soils in the Santa Elena Ophiolite, a landscape-biogeographical approach",
    "abstract": "The Santa Elena Ophiolite is a well-studied ultramafic system in Costa Rica mainly comprised of peridotites. Here, tropical climatic conditions promote active laterite formation processes, but the biogeochemistry of the resulting serpentine soils is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the soil geochemical composition and microbial community of contrasting landscapes in the area, as the foundation to start exploring the biogeochemistry of metals occurring there. The soils were confirmed as Ni-rich serpentine soils but differed depending on their geographical location within the ophiolite area, showing three serpentine soil types. Weathering processes resulted in mountain soils rich in trace metals such as cobalt, manganese and nickel. The lowlands showed geochemical variations despite sharing similar landscapes: the inner ophiolite lowland soils were more like the surrounding mountain soils rather than the north lowland soils at the border of the ophiolite area, and within the same riparian basin, concentrations of trace metals were higher downstream towards the mangrove area. Microbial community composition reflected the differences in geochemical composition of soils and revealed potential geomicrobiological inputs to local metal biogeochemistry: iron redox cycling bacteria were more abundant in the mountain soils, while more manganese-oxidizing bacteria were found in the lowlands, with the highest relative abundance in the mangrove areas. The fundamental ecological associations recorded in the serpentine soils of the Santa Elena Peninsula, and its potential as a serpentinization endemism hotspot, demonstrate that is a model site to study the biogeochemistry, geomicrobiology and ecology of tropical serpentine areas.

    "title": "Release of organic nitrogen compounds from Kerogen via catalytic hydropyrolysis - Geochemical Transactions",
    "abstract": "High hydrogen pressure pyrolysis (hydropyrolysis) was performed on samples of solvent extracted Kimmeridge Clay Formation source rock with a maturity equivalent to ca. 0.35% vitrinite reflectance. We describe the types and distributions of organic nitrogen compounds in the pyrolysis products (hydropyrolysates) using GC-MS. Compounds identified included alkyl-substituted indoles, carbazoles, benzocarbazoles, quinolines and benzoquinolines. The distributions of the isomers of methylcarbazoles, C 2 -alkylcarbazoles and benzocarbazoles in the hydropyrolysates were compared to a typical North Sea oil. The hydropyrolysates compared to the North Sea oil, showed increased contributions from alkylcarbazole isomers where the nitrogen group is \"exposed\" (no alkyl substituents adjacent to the nitrogen functionality) and appreciable levels of benzo[ b ]carbazole relative to benzo[ a ]- and benzo[ c ]carbazoles. Hydropyrolysis is found to be an ideal technique for liberating appreciable quantities of heterocyclic organic nitrogen compounds from geomacromolecules. The products released from the immature Kimmeridge Clay are thought to represent a potential source of nitrogen compounds in the bound phase (kerogen) able to contribute to the free bitumen phase during catagenesis."

    "title": "Immobilization of Cr(VI) by sulphate green rust and sulphidized nanoscale zerovalent iron in sand media: batch and column studies",
    "abstract": "Chromate, Cr(VI), contamination in soil and groundwater poses serious threat to living organisms and environmental health worldwide. Sulphate green rust (GR SO4 ), a naturally occurring mixed-valent iron layered double hydroxide has shown to be highly effective in the reduction of Cr(VI) to poorly soluble Cr(III), giving promise for its use as reactant for in situ remedial applications. However, little is known about its immobilization efficiency inside porous geological media, such as soils and sediments, where this reactant would ultimately be applied. In this study, we tested the removal of Cr(VI) by GR SO4 in quartz sand fixed-bed column systems (diameter × length = 1.4 cm × 11 cm), under anoxic conditions. Cr(VI) removal efficiency (relative to the available reducing equivalents in the added GR SO4 ) was determined by evaluating breakthrough curves performed at different inlet Cr(VI) concentrations (0.125–1 mM) which are representative of Cr(VI) concentrations found at contaminated sites, different flow rates (0.25–3 ml/min) and solution pH (4.5, 7 and 9.5). Results showed that (i) increasing Cr(VI) inlet concentration substantially decreased Cr(VI) removal efficiency of GR SO4 , (ii) flow rates had a lower impact on removal efficiencies, although values tended to be lower at higher flow rates, and (iii) Cr(VI) removal was enhanced at acidic pH conditions compared to neutral and alkaline conditions. For comparison, Cr(VI) removal by sulphidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (S-nZVI) in identical column experiments was substantially lower, indicating that S-nZVI reactivity with Cr(VI) is much slower compared to GR SO4 . Overall, GR SO4 performed reasonably well, even at the highest tested flow rate, showing its versatility and suitability for Cr(VI) remediation applications in high flow environments."

    "title": "Indexical methods assessing PTEs distribution in Mahan river command area, central India’s coal mining zone",
    "abstract": "The quality of water can significantly affect the regional water resources due to scarcity of potable water in industrial area. The purpose of this study was to explore potentially toxic trace elements (PTEs) contamination and their seasonal variations in different water sources within the coal mining area of the Mahan River command area, Central India. To achieve this, 96 water samples were collected across two distinct seasons and analysed for PTEs. The results indicate that during the pre-monsoon season, the concentrations of Mn (18%), Cu (4%), Pb (8%), Ni (18%), Cd (2%), Al (4%), Cr (2%), and Fe (30%) exceeded permissible limits. In the post-monsoon season, Mn (15%), Pb (6%), Ni (15%), Cd (2%), Al (15%), Fe (46%) and Ba (4%) surpassed the standards. The multiple groundwater pollution indexical methods further revealed that 14% [Heavy metal pollution index (HPI)], 14% [Heavy metal evaluation index (HEI)], 18% [Contamination index (CI)], 14% [the entropy-weight based HM contamination index (EHCI)] and 20% [Heavy metal index (HMI)] of the samples exceeded permissible thresholds during the pre-monsoon season. Similarly, during the post-monsoon period, 10% (HPI), 10% (HEI), 15% (CI), 15% (EHCI) and 17% (HMI) of the samples were above acceptable limits. The relationship between the pH of water and the total load of dissolved metals is established using Caboi plot, confirming that mine water from mine water from Bhatgaon Underground (UG), Mahamaya UG, and Mahan Opencast (OC) [PR40, PR41, PR42, PR43, PR47, and PR48], surrounding rivers, and groundwater sources, exhibited an “Acid-High Metal” characteristic. This suggests significant contamination from acid mine drainage and mineral dissolution. Apart from the anthropogenic inputs, geogenic and environmental processes are responsible for the current distribution of PTEs and their seasonal variations."

    "title": "The effect of pH and ionic strength on the adsorption of glyphosate onto ferrihydrite",
    "abstract": "Although, glyphosate ( N -(phosphonomethyl) glycine) is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world, its interaction with poorly crystalline iron oxides, such as ferrihydrite, is not well studied. In this research, we examined the adsorption of glyphosate onto ferrihydrite using infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), adsorption kinetic models and adsorption isotherm models. The effect of pH and sodium chloride concentration on the adsorption of glyphosate onto ferrihydrite as well as the effect of extractors (CaCl 2 0.010 mol L −1 and Mehlich) on the desorption of glyphosate were also evaluated. There are two important findings described in this work. First, 84% of adsorbed glyphosate strongly interacted to ferrihydrite as an inner-sphere complex and phosphate and amine groups are involved in this interaction. Second, an increase of sodium chloride salt concentration increased the adsorption of glyphosate onto ferrihydrite. The non-linear Langmuir model and pseudo second order model showed a good agreement of theoretical limit of glyphosate adsorbed onto ferrihydrite, 54.88 µg mg −1 and 48.8 µg mg −1 , respectively. The adsorption of glyphosate onto ferrihydrite decreased when the pH increased. Under the conditions used in this work, EPR spectra did not show dissolution of ferrihydrite. Surface area, pore volume and pH pzc of ferrihydrite decreased after adsorption of glyphosate."

    "title": "A comparative study of the risk assessment and heavy metal contamination of coastal sediments in the Red sea, Egypt, between the cities of El-Quseir and Safaga",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the influence of pollution on the quality of sediments and the risks associated with El-Qusier and Safaga Cities, Red Sea, Egypt, during 2021, divided into four sectors, using multiple pollution indices. To achieve that, we evaluated the metal pollution index (MPI), contamination factor (Cf), pollution load index (PLI), contamination security index (CSI), and anthropogenicity (Anp%). Moreover, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks are used for human health hazards. Results indicated that Mn and Fe recorded the highest concentrations, whereas Cd had the lowest. El-Quseir City sediments were found the following metal ions: Fe > Mn > Ni > Zn > Cu > Co > Pb > Cd, where the order in the Safaga City was: Fe > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cu > Pb > Co > Cd. MPI > 1, this is alarming in the study area due to heavy metal pollution. In addition, C f < 1 in all metals except Cd with contamination degree CD ranged from low to considerable contamination in El-Qusier city. In contrast, contamination ranged from significant to very high in Safaga city. PLI < 1 is lower than the reference at all monitored stations. CSI values ranged from relatively low to moderate. Besides Cd, data reflect each element's low environmental danger (Eri Me 40). This study's risk index (RI) is low to moderate in Sector 1 and high to extremely high in Sector 2. HQ and HI index < 1 means it is safe for human health in order: HI ingestion > HI dermal . CSR for different pathways was recorded as dermal > ingestion, in which total CSR for all paths is considered harmful, and the cancer risk is troublesome and higher than the reference ranges of 1 × 10 –6 –1 × 10 –4 . In conclusion, the examined heavy metals provide environmental hazards across the assessed locations."

    "title": "Regional geochemical baseline concentration of potentially toxic trace metals in the mineralized Lom Basin, East Cameroon: a tool for contamination assessment",
    "abstract": "The distribution of trace metals in active stream sediments from the mineralized Lom Basin has been evaluated. Fifty-five bottom sediments were collected and the mineralogical composition of six pulverized samples determined by XRD. The fine fraction (< 150 µm) was subjected to total digestion (HClO 4 + HF + HCl) and analyzed for trace metals using a combination of ICP-MS and AAS analytical methods. Results show that the mineralogy of stream sediments is dominated by quartz (39–86%), phyllosilicates (0–45%) and feldspars (0–27%). Mean concentrations of the analyzed metals are low (e.g. As = 99.40 µg/kg, Zn = 573.24 µg/kg, V = 963.14 µg/kg and Cr = 763.93 µg/kg). Iron and Mn have significant average concentrations of 28.325 and 442 mg/kg, respectively. Background and threshold values of the trace metals were computed statistically to determine geochemical anomalies of geologic or anthropogenic origin, particularly mining activity. Factor analysis, applied on normalized data, identified three associations: Ni–Cr–V–Co–As–Se–pH, Cu–Zn–Hg–Pb–Cd–Sc and Fe–Mn. The first association is controlled by source geology and the neutral pH, the second by sulphide mineralization and the last by chemical weathering of ferromagnesian minerals. Spatial analysis reveals similar distribution trends for Co–Cr–V–Ni and Cu–Zn–Pb–Sc reflecting the lithology and sulphide mineralization in the basin. Relatively high levels of As were concordant with reported gold occurrences in the area while Fe and Mn distribution are consistent with their source from the Fe-bearing metamorphic rocks. These findings provide baseline geochemical values for common and parallel geological domains in the eastern region of Cameroon. Although this study shows that the stream sediments are not polluted, the evaluation of metal composition in environmental samples from abandoned and active mine sites for comparison and environmental health risk assessment is highly recommended."

    "title": "Catalytic oxidation of arsenite and reaction pathways on the surface of CuO nanoparticles at a wide range of pHs",
    "abstract": "Recently, the wide application of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) in engineering field inevitably leads to its release into various geologic settings, which has aroused great concern about the geochemical behaviors of CuO NPs due to its high surface reactivity and impact on the fate of co-existing contaminants. However, the redox transformation of pollutants mediated by CuO NPs and the underlying mechanism still remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the interaction of CuO NPs with As(III), and explored the reaction pathways using batch experiments and multiple spectroscopic techniques. The results of in situ quick scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Q-XAS) analysis verified that CuO NPs is capable of catalytically oxidize As(III) under dark conditions efficiently at a wide range of pHs. As(III) was firstly adsorbed on CuO NPs surface and then gradually oxidized to As(V) with dissolved O 2 as the terminal electron acceptor. As(III) adsorption increased to the maximum at a pH close to PZC of CuO NPs (~ pH 9.2), and then sharply decreased with increasing pH, while the oxidation capacity monotonically increased with pH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization of samples from batch experiments indicated that two pathways may be involved in As(III) catalytic oxidation: (1) direct electron transfer from As(III) to Cu(II), followed by concomitant re-oxidation of the produced Cu(I) by dissolved O 2 back to Cu(II) on CuO NPs surface, and (2) As(III) oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from the above Cu(I) oxygenation process. These observations facilitate a better understanding of the surface catalytic property of CuO NPs and its interaction with As(III) and other elements with variable valence in geochemical environments."

    "title": "A single column separation method for barium isotope analysis of geologic and hydrologic materials with complex matrices",
    "abstract": "The increasing significance of barium (Ba) in environmental and geologic research in recent years has led to interest in the application of the Ba isotopic composition as a tracer for natural materials with complex matrices. Most Ba isotope measurement techniques require separation of Ba from the rest of sample prior to analysis. This paper presents a method using readily available materials and disposable columns that effectively separates Ba from a range of geologic and hydrologic materials, including carbonate minerals, silicate rocks, barite, river water, and fluids with high total dissolved solids and organic content such as oil and gas brines, rapidly and without need for an additional cleanup column. The technique involves off-the-shelf columns and cation exchange resin and a two-reagent elution that uses 2.5 N HCl followed by addition of 2.0 N HNO 3 . We present data to show that major matrix elements from almost any natural material are separated from Ba in a single column pass, and that the method also effectively reduces or eliminates isobaric interferences from lanthanum and cerium."

    "title": "Influences on tidal channel and aquaculture shrimp pond water chemical composition in Southwest Bangladesh",
    "abstract": "Detailed geochemical studies of both major and minor elements in Bangladesh surface waters are sparse, particularly in shrimp aquaculture pond environments. Therefore, water samples from shrimp aquaculture ponds and tidal channels were collected in high precipitation (July) and low precipitation (May) months from 2018–2019 in Southwest Bangladesh and analyzed for complete water chemistry. Selenium (Se) and arsenic (As) were elevated above WHO guidelines in 50% and ~ 87% of samples, respectively, but do not show any recognizable spatial patterns. Shrimp pond and tidal channel water compositions in the dry season (May) are similar, illustrating their connectivity and minimal endogenous effects within shrimp ponds. Tidal channels are less saline in July than shrimp ponds still irrigated by tidal channels, suggesting that either farmers limit irrigation to continue farming saltwater shrimp, or the irrigation flux is low and leads to a lag in aquaculture-tidal channel compositional homogenization. δ 18 O and δ 2 H isotopic compositions from samples in May of 2019 reveal tidal channel samples are closer to the local meteoric water line (LMWL) than shrimp pond samples, because of less evaporation. However, evaporation in May shrimp ponds has a minimal effect on water composition, likely because of regular drainage/exchange of pond waters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is positively correlated with both δ 18 O and δ 2 H in shrimp ponds, suggesting that as evaporation increases, DOC becomes enriched. Multiple linear regression reveals that As and Se can be moderately predicted (adjusted R 2 values between 0.4 and 0.7, p < 0.01) in surface waters of our study with only 3–4 independent predictor variables (e.g., Ni, V and DOC for Se prediction; Cu, V, Ni and P for As prediction). Thus, this general approach should be followed in other regions throughout the world when measurements for certain hazardous trace elements such as Se and As may be lacking in several samples from a dataset."

    "title": "Simulating CO2 dynamics in Brackish Lake Obuchi, Japan: Low pCO2 maintenance through diverse nutrient inputs",
    "abstract": "Coastal waters play a crucial role as a pathway for the transport of terrestrial chemical constituents to marine environments. Carbon cycling in coastal areas is essential for understanding climate change. Here, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecosystem model to investigate CO 2 dynamics and its controlling factors in Lake Obuchi, a brackish lake in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The model successfully reproduced the seasonal variations in water temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll- a , and carbonate system components in the lake. The simulation results show that the partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ) in Lake Obuchi remained below atmospheric levels throughout the year, suggesting that the lake functions as a CO 2 sink. The p CO 2 variability is dominated by spatially uniform seasonal patterns (90% of variance) driven by temperature changes, while summer periods exhibit distinct spatial patterns (6.0% of variance) that vary with river discharge magnitude. In Lake Obuchi, p CO 2 is maintained at low levels because of the carbonate system components of water masses formed by mixing river water and seawater. Additionally, primary production within these water masses further reduces p CO 2 . This primary production is sustained by nitrogen-rich river water, combined with seasonal phosphorus supply from sediments during summer and autumn and from the sea during winter and spring. Our findings reveal that the seasonal combination of these nutrient sources maintains year-round primary production, which in turn contributes to the reduction in p CO 2 in Lake Obuchi."

    "title": "Cyclostratigraphy of the Miocene Nakayama Formation on Sado Island in central Japan and paleoceanographic implications",
    "abstract": "Although siliceous sediments have the potential to reveal an enigmatic Miocene climate evolution, problems with age model construction are tough to beat. Cyclostratigraphy is a useful tool for the construction of a high-resolution age model. In the Japan Sea region, orbital-scale oscillations in the sedimentary environment of the Miocene sedimentary basins are reported, for example, the Onnagawa Formation in Akita Prefecture in northern Japan and the Nakayama Formation on Sado Island in central Japan. In this study, we constructed a high-resolution age model of the Miocene siliceous sediment in the Japan Sea, the Nakayama Formation, by cyclostratigraphy using the geochemical properties of the sediment. Ratios of the biogenic silica content to the detritus content in the sediment were determined based on the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Orbital-scale oscillations were identified in the ratios of biogenic silica to detritus, and it was used for cyclostratigraphic correlation with the global oxygen stable isotope (δ 18 O) curve of benthic foraminifera. Our new cyclostratigraphic age model and method are expected to promote using the Miocene siliceous sediments for paleoceanographic and paleoclimatologic studies. Additionally, major element and mineral compositions determined by XRF and XRD analysis were used to reconstruct the sedimentary environment on which the East Asian Monsoon system may have an influence."

    "title": "Review of radiolarian microfossils as a tool for reconstructing sea surface temperature of the past in the Northwest Pacific",
    "abstract": "In this review we re-evaluated the potential of radiolarian species as palaeoceanographic proxies in the Northwest Pacific Ocean relying on 33 new samples collected since 2021, combined with already published datasets. Our re-evaluation revealed significant differences between Sea of Japan and Northwest Pacific radiolarian assemblages, leading to the exclusion of the Sea of Japan dataset for further sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions in the Northwest Pacific. By employing factor analyses, we were able to identify four distinct radiolarian assemblages characterizing the Northwest Pacific and East China Sea as follows: the Subtropical, the Sea of Okhotsk-related subarctic, the Oyashio Current to transitional zone-related, and the coastal water assemblages. Each assemblage showed specific species associations with different water masses and SST ranges. Species like Tetrapyle circularis / fruticosa and Dictyocoryne tetrathalamus were associated with waters above 24 °C, while Lithomelissa setosa and Ceratospyris borealis were associated temperatures below 14 °C. Based on a review of the literature about modern radiolarian species blooming conditions in the Northwest Pacific, we suggest that radiolarian species-based reconstructed SSTs more likely infer summer SSTs. Applying weighted averaging partial least squares transfer function on selected radiolarian species showing strong affinities with changes in summer SST, we re-evaluated past summer SSTs at IODP Site U1429 in the northern East China Sea with high accuracy (R 2 = 0.97, error margin ± 1.4 °C). Our radiolarian-based summer SST reconstruction is similar to Globigerinoides ruber Mg/Ca-based summer SSTs, though showing minor disparities during glacial periods, while constant disparities were observed with alkenone-based SST estimates at the same site, which is likely due to seasonal biases. Notably, we identified L. setosa as a potential proxy for East Asian Winter Monsoon intensity."

    "title": "Origin of interstitial water beneath the continental shelf offshore northwestern Australia: insights from hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions",
    "abstract": "We analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of interstitial water collected from Miocene–Quaternary carbonate platforms beneath the continental shelf margin off northwestern Australia during the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 356. By integrating isotope data with onboard salinity and chemical concentration measurements, we investigated the behavior of interstitial water in this continental shelf system. The interstitial water was classified into three groups based on salinity. Group 1 (salinity = 34−40) consisted of upper low-salinity water infiltrating from the modern seafloor, transitioning downward into highly saline water. This high-salinity water likely formed in situ during glacial periods. Group 3, characterized by extremely high salinity (salinity = 101−153), likely originated from the Late Miocene seawater modified by evaporation in an arid coastal environment. Group 2 (salinity = 43−98) represented a mixture of Groups 1 and 3. This study offers valuable insights into the hydrology of modern and ancient carbonate platforms, with implications for similar systems worldwide."

    "abstract": "To date, empirical relationships have been observed for the distributions and variations of stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios (δ 15 N and δ 13 C, respectively) in ecosystems as well as in living organisms. Here, we investigated δ 15 N values of internal organs of various animal species, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The δ 15 N differences of these organs from the corresponding muscles vary within a range of ± 4‰. In general, the δ 15 N values of the brain and heart are higher than those of the corresponding muscles, except in birds. This may indicate that excreted ammonia is recycled in their cecum. We propose a kinetic descriptive schemas for a nitrogen isotope model of deamination that maintains a TDF of 8.0‰ for glutamate in muscle mitochondria. Differences in the δ 15 N in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain are evident across species because the cells that make up the organ differ greatly in shape and organization, and the amount and shape of mitochondria distributed in these organs change dynamically. These facts may be the first step to clarify the significance of organ δ 15 N variation for animal growth physiology and possibly for animal biochemical evolution. These evidences of δ 15 N variations at intact and organ level in biota may provide a new broad avenue to investigate paleoecology and its environmental conditions."

    "title": "New parameter of roundness R: circularity corrected by aspect ratio",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new roundness parameter R , to denote circularity corrected by aspect ratio. The basic concept of this new roundness parameter is given by the following equation: $$ R=\\mathrm{Circularity} + \\left({\\mathrm{Circularity}}_{\\mathrm{perfect}\\ \\mathrm{circle}}-{\\mathrm{Circularity}}_{\\mathrm{aspect}\\ \\mathrm{ratio}}\\right) $$ where Circularity perfect circle is the maximum value of circularity and Circularity aspect ratio is the circularity when only the aspect ratio varies from that of a perfect circle. Based on tests of digital circle and ellipse images using ImageJ software, the effective sizes and aspect ratios of such images for the calculation of R were found to range between 100 and 1024 pixels, and 10:1 to 10:10, respectively. R is thus given by $$ R = {\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{I}} + \\left(0.913-{\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{AR}}\\right) $$ where C I is the circularity measured using ImageJ software and C AR is the sixth-degree function of the aspect ratio measured using the same software. The correlation coefficient between the new parameter R and Krumbein’s roundness is 0.937 (adjusted coefficient of determination = 0.874). Results from the application of R to modern beach and slope deposits showed that R is able to quantitatively separate both types of material in terms of roundness. Therefore, we believe that the new roundness parameter R will be useful for performing precise statistical analyses of the roundness of particles in the future."

    "title": "Olivine–ringwoodite transformation in Katol meteorite: implications for localized superheating of chondritic melt and seismic attenuation",
    "abstract": "Constraining the superheating of impact melt offers insights into the temperature gradient within shock-melt veins, affecting the growth rate of polymorphic transformations and liquidus phase crystallization. Furthermore, these changes influence crucial geological and geophysical parameters, including seismic attenuation. Here, we examine the composition, texture, and growth kinetics of ringwoodites in the Katol chondrite. Temperature–time history and growth rate analysis reveal a high-pressure pulse duration of ~ 0.4 s. Our findings suggest that the chondritic melt in the Katol chondrite reached ~ 2630 K, approximately 307 K above liquidus. Moreover, we observe a significant influence of melt temperature on ringwoodite growth rate and grain size, highlighting how thermal perturbations in planetary interiors can enhance polymorphic phase transformation kinetics, thus controlling rheological properties. Additionally, we show that transformation-induced grain size reductions may decrease attenuation by up to three orders of magnitude for low-frequency regimes at a localized scale, while variations in growth rate can impact the material’s response to diverse stress oscillation frequencies."

    "title": "Intermobility of barium, strontium, and lead in chloride and sulfate leach solutions",
    "abstract": "Production of radionuclide-free copper concentrates is dependent on understanding and controlling the deportment of daughter radionuclides (RNs) produced from 238 U decay, specifically 226 Ra, 210 Pb, and 210 Po. Sulfuric acid leaching is currently employed in the Olympic Dam processing plant (South Australia) to remove U and fluorine from copper concentrates prior to smelting but does not adequately remove the aforementioned RN. Due to chemical similarities between lead and alkaline earth metals (including Ra), two sets of experiments were designed to understand solution interactions between Sr, Ba, and Pb at various conditions. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) isotopic spatial distribution maps and laser ablation inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry transects were performed on laboratory-grown crystals of baryte, celestite, and anglesite which had been exposed to different solutions under different pH and reaction time conditions. Analysis of experimental products reveals three uptake mechanisms: overgrowth of nearly pure SrSO 4 and PbSO 4 on baryte; incorporation of minor of Pb and Ba into celestite due to diffusion; and extensive replacement of Pb by Sr (and less extensive replacement of Pb by Ba) in anglesite via coupled dissolution-reprecipitation reactions. The presence of H 2 SO 4 either enhanced or inhibited these reactions. Kinetic modelling supports the experimental results, showing potential for extrapolating the (Sr, Ba, Pb)SO 4 system to encompass RaSO 4 . Direct observation of grain-scale element distributions by nanoSIMS aids understanding of the controlling conditions and mechanisms of replacement that may be critical steps for Pb and Ra removal from concentrates by allowing construction of a cationic replacement scenario targeting Pb or Ra, or ideally all insoluble sulfates. Experimental results provide a foundation for further investigation of RN uptake during minerals processing, especially during acid leaching. The new evidence enhances understanding of micro- to nanoscale chemical interactions and not only aids determination of where radionuclides reside during each processing stage but also guides development of flowsheets targeting their removal."

    "title": "Evaluation of processes driving iodine monoxide and ozone variability over the Western Pacific warm pool",
    "abstract": "Iodine chemistry exerts a nonnegligible influence on tropospheric ozone depletion over oceanic regions. The impact of iodine has been extensively studied using three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs). However, the factors governing the variability of iodine monoxide (IO) and ozone in the marine boundary layer (MBL) remain uncertain. This study examines the impact of fine-scale meteorological variability and ozone-independent iodine sources on the MBL IO and ozone concentrations over the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) through ship-borne observations and high-resolution CTMs during November–December 2014. The high (0.56 \\(^\\circ\\) )-resolution model demonstrates a negative correlation between IO and ozone at the observation locations ( \\(r = -\\) 0.45), which is more closely aligned with that derived from the ship-borne observation data ( \\(r = -\\) 0.70) than the coarse (2.8 \\(^\\circ\\) )-resolution model ( \\(r =\\) 0.08). Sensitivity analysis indicates that a contrast in the correlation between the 0.56 \\(^\\circ\\) and 2.8 \\(^\\circ\\) resolutions emerges from the interplay of fine-scale atmospheric transport and chemistry processes, rather than from fine-scale atmospheric transport solely or ozone-dependent oceanic iodine release. This interplay leads to a greater ozone loss mediated by the iodine cycle at 0.56 \\(^\\circ\\) resolution (by 0.56 ppbv day \\(^{-1}\\) ) compared to that at 2.8 \\(^\\circ\\) resolution (by 0.20 ppbv day \\(^{-1}\\) ), due to the reduced mixing with air outside the MBL over the WPWP at finer resolution. Furthermore, incorporating ozone-independent iodine sources such as photolysis of \\({\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{I}_{2}}\\) , \\({\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{IBr}}\\) , and \\({\\text{CH}_{2}\\text{ICl}}\\) enhances the IO-ozone anti-correlation coefficient (−0.50). These findings highlight the critical roles of interplay of the fine-scale atmospheric transport and chemistry processes and oceanic ozone-independent iodine sources in the co-variability of IO and ozone over the WPWP."

    "title": "Machine-learning-based spatial analysis of the spring states in the southernmost Eurasian permafrost, Hangai Mountains, central Mongolia",
    "abstract": "Springs are the vital ecosystem resource for pastoral livelihood in the southernmost regions of Eurasian permafrost but are currently experiencing depletion. However, their spatial distribution and factors influencing this depletion remain unassessed. This study evaluates the recent status of springs that were discharging several decades ago in the Hangai Mountains, Mongolia. A total of 1,620 spring sites were identified, and states (either still discharging or already depleted) of 228 springs were determined through field observations conducted in July and August 2019, along with visible satellite imagery taken between 2008 and 2020. To predict the states of remaining 1392 springs, machine learning approaches, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied, incorporating vegetation indices and topographically derived hydrological parameters as explanatory variables. Given the imbalanced datasets (depleted: 44, discharging: 192) and the small sample size of training and test datasets, cross-validation and min–max normalization were employed to minimize overfitting problems. The models demonstrated high predictive performance, with area under curves of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) are 0.84 (LR), 0.86 (RF), and 0.84 (SVM). Additionally, the AUC of precision and recall (AUC-PR), criteria indicating the model performance for imbalanced datasets, increased by 0.32–0.52 compared to the case in random classification. The most important explanatory variables for determining spring states were the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI); springs in the relatively wet and vegetated environments tended to remain discharging, whereas those in arid environments were more likely to be depleted. An ensemble of the three models predicted that 22.5% of springs in the Hangai Mountains have already been depleted. In extensive permafrost regions, spring depletion is largely driven by decline in modern precipitation. In transitional zones where permafrost and non-permafrost areas coexist, the thickening of active layer and increases in unfrozen water contents help to sustain spring discharge despite ongoing aridification."

    "title": "Integrated aircraft and research vessel observational studies of aerosols and clouds in summer over the western North Pacific",
    "abstract": "An integrated observational study of aerosols and clouds was carried out in summer 2022 over the western North Pacific (off the eastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan) using both an aircraft and a research vessel for the first time in this area. The aim of this experiment was to characterize the physical and chemical properties of aerosols and to evaluate the contributions of anthropogenic and natural emissions to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations. The experiment also aims to examine the vertical structure of low-level clouds, which have high radiative effects, over this region. Here, we present an overview of the experiment and some preliminary results. Onboard the research vessel, suspended particulate matter in seawater was sampled, and the size distributions of dominant particle types (e.g., diatom fragments and organic matter) were determined. By analyzing atmospheric aerosols sampled from aircraft, we derived the number size distributions of dust-like particles in the air far from source regions. The aerosol size distributions, as measured from both the vessel and aircraft, suggested that most of the aerosols that could act as CCN were of anthropogenic origin: The upper-bound estimate of the sea spray aerosol (SSA) contribution to the CCN concentration at altitudes below 1200 m was 23%. Numerical model simulations generally reproduced the observed aerosol number concentrations. The simulations supported the inference from the observation that most CCN over the study area were of anthropogenic origin. Using this model, SSA emissions were estimated to account for 9% of the cloud radiative effect. Cloud observations from aircraft revealed that low-level clouds tended to have an adiabatic vertical structure under cold air advection, whereas under warm air advection, they occasionally had a layered structure. Such diverse vertical structures of low-level clouds are not generally seen in the subtropics. The integrated observations carried out in this study provided a basic picture of aerosols and clouds over the study area in summer. Further research is needed to elucidate the roles of aerosols in cloud formation and the radiation budget under various meteorological conditions within the framework of atmosphere–ocean interactions."

    "title": "Longitudinal heterogeneity of Phobos’ crater size-frequency distribution: coevolution of resurfacing and orbital dynamics",
    "abstract": "Phobos always keeps the same side facing its host planet like Earth’s Moon, making it a key comparative target for studying the coevolution of planet–satellite systems. The heterogeneity of satellite surface evolution under a host planet’s gravity is crucial for understanding the evolution of such systems. This study examines the crater size–frequency distribution (CSFD) across four equatorial regions of Phobos—leading, near, trailing, and far sides—to investigate surface evolution heterogeneities linked to resurfacing and orbital dynamics following the formation of its largest crater, Stickney. We focus on the crater size indicating the number of craters lower than expected from the production function (PF) model. We also estimate the crater erasure scale due to the ejecta blanket and assess deviations in the size–frequency distribution (SFD) of impactors from the PF model. This study shows three main conclusions about surface heterogeneity in Phobos’ CSFD and ejecta blanket thickness. (1) The leading side experienced significant crater erasure, likely due to the thickest ejecta blanket from the Stickney impact. (2) The density of craters larger than \\(\\sim\\) 1.5 km reflects pre-Stickney conditions, whereas the densities of craters measuring 0.8–1.5 km and 400–800 m in diameter reflect post-Stickney surface evolution. (3) Crater number density on the near side was consistently lower than on the far side, likely due to planetary screening. This reduction in crater formation on the near side is particularly attributed to its proximity to Mars. Our results suggest that the leading side experienced the greatest deposition of the ejecta blanket on Phobos. This deposition likely occurred immediately after Stickney’s formation, followed by global resurfacing facilitated by Phobos’ post-Stickney impact spin. One possible explanation for the scarcity of craters smaller than 800 m is that later-arriving, low-energy impacts erased smaller preexisting craters while leaving larger ones comparatively well preserved, leading to a net reduction in their population."

    "title": "Stability and water solubility of calcium ferrite-type aluminum-rich phase: implications for deep water cycle caused by subducting basaltic crusts",
    "abstract": "The subducting crustal materials serve as a crucial channel for transporting water to the lower mantle. Recent experimental studies suggest that crustal materials such as basaltic crust can be a main water carrier and reservoir playing an important role on water cycling in the lower mantle. Despite being a primary mineral in crustal materials, the water solubility of calcium ferrite-type (CF) phase and its stability are unclear yet. A recent phase relation study of hydrous basalts showed Na-depletion in lower-mantle minerals, suggesting the presence of fluid possibly with high Na concentration and the absence of CF phase along the low-temperature slab geotherms, where Al-rich hydrous phase H and ferropericlase appear instead. These phases could consequently produce Na-depleted CF phase when reaching the dehydration temperature of Al-rich hydrous phase H. In this study, we investigated the stability and water solubility of CF-type MgAl 2 O 4 , which is a main CF component in a hydrous basalt, in water-bearing systems at 26–32 GPa and 1200–1900 °C using a Kawai-type multi-anvil press. Our results indicate that the stability of the CF phase is strongly influenced by water content in the system. Water contents of recovered CF phases estimated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy show a limited variation between 73 and 87 ppm wt at a pressure of 26 GPa and temperatures of 1500–1900 °C. We suggest that CF phase could not be a primary water carrier at lower mantle depths. This emphasizes contributions of hydrous aluminous silica minerals to Earth’s deep water cycling and heterogeneous structures in the lower mantle due to the strong water partitioning to this phase compared with other constituent minerals."

    "title": "Dissolved inorganic carbon entrainment into the mixed layer of the western subarctic North Pacific: a key process of ocean acidification under historical carbon dioxide emissions",
    "abstract": "This study investigated processes responsible for the acidification of the mixed layer water at station K2 ( \\(47^{\\circ }\\) N, \\(160^{\\circ }\\) E) in the western subarctic North Pacific by analyzing physical and biogeochemical variables during 1850–2014 in a Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth system model of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 under historical carbon dioxide ( \\(\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\) ) emissions. Analysis revealed an accelerated pH decline at a rate of −0.0015 \\(\\text{year}^{-1}\\) , which began around 1960. An increase in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is found to be the principal factor of the pH decline. DIC budget analysis of the mixed layer identified the primary physical process accelerating the DIC increase during 1960–2014: enhanced vertical entrainment of the DIC-rich deep water into the mixed layer during autumn–winter (rate of 3.1 \\({{{{\\upmu }}}} \\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{month}^{-1}\\) ). This enhancement is attributed to the equatorial Pacific frequent high sea surface temperature condition due to global warming and El Niño events through the model’s atmospheric teleconnection. \\(\\hbox {CO}_\\text{2}\\) gas exchange at the sea surface contributes secondarily to the DIC increase (0.16 \\({\\upmu }\\text{mol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{month}^{-1}\\) ).

    "title": "Rapid Holocene deposition in the Mackenzie Trough and Barrow Canyon areas in the western Arctic Ocean",
    "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean and terrestrial environment have recently been reported to be changing drastically, but it is unclear whether these changes are similar to natural variations in the past or how sudden and large the changes are compared to natural variations. This premise served as motivation to collect sediment cores during the summer of 2022 at four sites on the Canadian continental shelf and Alaskan upper continental slope to reconstruct changes in the marine and terrestrial environments to provide a comprehensive picture of the ocean environment during the preindustrial period before anthropogenic influences. We dated the sediments based on the 137 Cs radioactivity of bulk sediments and the 14 C concentrations of mollusk shells. The 137 Cs radioactivity shows a distinct onset corresponding to 1950 Common Era (CE) and the most prominent peak corresponding to 1963 CE. Multiple peaks appeared above the most prominent one, coinciding with nuclear power plant accidents in 1986 and 2011. Inventories of excess 210 Pb in all cores exceed the estimated supply of excess 210 Pb from atmospheric deposition, likely due to the scavenging supply of excess 210 Pb. By comparing 137 Cs and radiocarbon conventional ages, we estimated the local radiocarbon reservoir age value of each site. Using these local radiocarbon reservoir age and the conventional ages of mollusk shell samples, we established the age-depth models by the Bayesian method. The optimal ΔR values were 598, 511, 65, and –60 years at the MT1, MT2, BC2, and BC2-2 sites, respectively. The cores consist of clayey silts continuously deposited with uniquely high sedimentation rates of 0.17 to 0.74 cm y −1 . Variation in the Ca/Ti ratio indicates ~ 20, ~ 30, 50–60, 100–125, and 300-year cycles, likely attributed to the variation in the Aleutian Low that controls the Bering Strait inflow of Pacific waters influencing our core sites. These sediments will be used for further high-resolution, multi-proxy studies with forthcoming results."

    "title": "Spatiotemporal variation of aftershock activity in northern source region of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake by long-term ocean bottom seismometers",
    "abstract": "A huge plate boundary earthquake eventuated between the Pacific plate and the landward plate in 2011 and was named the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake. Following the mainshock, many aftershocks were generated. It is essential to obtain spatiotemporal variation of aftershock activity for understanding of mechanism of the earthquake generation. Because extensive seafloor aftershock observations using many ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) were performed following the mainshock until September 2011, a precise aftershock distribution just after the mainshock had been revealed. After the urgent OBS aftershock observation, we started seismic monitoring using long-term OBSs (LTOBSs) in the source area. Thirty-nine LTOBSs were deployed in September 2011, and the observation had been continued for approximately ten months. In September 2013, thirty LTOBSs were deployed in the northern source region and recovered one year later. From long-term observations, spatiotemporal variation of the aftershock activity in the northern source region of the mainshock was revealed. Because we had carried out a LTOBS observation in the study area before the mainshock, the seismicity before the mainshock and aftershock activities was compared. Source positions of the events were determined by P and S-wave arrival times, and focal mechanisms of them were obtained using polarities of vertical components of the first arrivals. Large slip areas have little seismicity during the whole period of the observations. It is deduced from a low seismicity area that the stress in the large slip region had not been recovered 3 years after the mainshock. In contrast, a seismic activity become high just after the mainshock comparing the seismicity before the mainshock in the region off Iwate prefecture. Although many earthquakes in the inside of the plates had normal and strike-slip focal mechanisms from 2011 to 2012, some thrust focal mechanism events also occurred. A ratio of earthquakes occurring near the plate boundary with thrust focal mechanism seems to increase in 2013 and 2014 compared to 2011 and 2012. We interpret the increase in thrust-type earthquakes as indicative of stress change starting at the edge of the large slip region of the mainshock."

    "abstract": "The current work is an attempt to reveal the possible utilization of the radiometric measurements to build-up a complete genetic scenario for magmatic, hydrothermal, and supergene uranium mineralization. For this purpose, ground gamma-ray survey was performed through the exploratory tunnels dug perpendicular to El-Missikat and El-Erediya shear zones, the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt. Contents of U, Th, and K were measured for the host pink granite (e.g., avg.15.94 U ppm, 35.62 Th ppm, and 6.63% K), alteration zones (brecciation, silicification, greisenization, kaolinization and hematitization) (e.g., avg. 124.01 U ppm, 63.67 Th ppm, and 3.13% K), and mineralized silica veins (e.g., avg. 312.65 U ppm, 92.22 Th ppm, and 2.62% K). All of these data were graphically represented as correlation plots of Th vs. U, Th/U vs. U, Th vs. K, and U/K vs. Th/K. The overall results indicate magmatic, hydrothermal, and supergene sources of El-Missikat and El-Erediya U mineralization. The magma-derived U contents are enclosed mainly in the pink granite that is mostly characterized by normal Th/U (2.5–5) and Th/K ratios (3–5*10 –4 ). The hydrothermal processes through the alteration zones and mineralized silica veins are reflected by the weak correlation of Th with U (e.g. r = 0.13 and − 0.39), the strong negative correlation of Th/U ratio with U (e.g. r = − 0.82), 2.5˃Th/U˃0.1, Th/K˃5*10 –4 , Th/K < 3*10 –4 , and the strong positive correlation of U/K with Th/K (e.g. r = 0.91) as well as the occurrence of thorite, columbite, xenotime and hydrothermal zircon (0.5 > Th/U ≤ 0.1). Afterwards, the hydrothermal mineralization underwent some degrees of chemical weathering that resulted in supergene U mineralization whose fingerprints can be traced by the occurrence of secondary U minerals (e.g. kasolite and uranophane), Th/U ratios ≤ 0.1, and the weak correlation between Th/K and U/K (e.g. r = 0.39 and − 0.11)."

    "abstract": "In recent years, golf courses have significantly contributed to the economic growth of Vietnamese cities like Hanoi. However, their environmental and social impacts—particularly regarding land use, pesticide application, water resources, and environmental degradation—remain a concern. This study utilizes Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery combined with geographic information systems to monitor golf courses in Hanoi’s metropolitan area. Through time-series multispectral data, we evaluate two detection methods: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis and feature recognition. NDVI analysis, with an average NDVI value of 0.55–0.75 for turf grass, initially showed potential but faced classification challenges due to overlapping vegetation signatures with parks and agricultural fields. Conversely, feature recognition demonstrated strong accuracy, correctly identifying over 85% of golf course areas by leveraging distinctive characteristics such as bunker shape and turf grass arrangement. The integration of Sentinel-2 imagery with spectral mixing analysis further improved boundary delineation, reducing misclassification rates from 18% (using Landsat) to 7%. This research establishes a remote sensing-based golf course database covering over 2,500 hectares in Hanoi, tracks and land conversion trends over the past decade, and provides quantitative insights into sustainable golf course management. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of combining high-resolution satellite data and advanced classification techniques to support environmentally responsible urban land use planning. This study highlights and the growing role of remote sensing technologies in urban planning and environmental conservation, paving the way for further applications in sustainable land management."

    "abstract": "Internal tides are crucial in ocean dynamics and are a source of error in marine acoustic measurements. In Global Navigation Satellite System-Acoustic combination technique (GNSS-A) seafloor crustal deformation observations, which contribute to earthquake and plate subduction sciences, the effect of internal tides has never been estimated, even though it has been predicted. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of internal tides on GNSS-A observations by numerical reproduction and used data from the GNSS-A observation network around Japan to quantitatively identify the effect of internal tides on GNSS-A observations for the first time. As a result, we clarified the mechanism of internal tidal effects for GNSS-A. Long-term sound speed disturbances during GNSS-A observations were generally explained by a semidiurnal internal tide in modes 1 to 3. GNSS-A is affected by the horizontal wavelength, mode, and direction of the internal tides and can be used to grasp those features. In future, these results are expected to contribute to progress in multidisciplinary research, such as the construction of advanced physical models and analytical methods."

Since its introduction, the scanning SQUID microscope system has been used to measure various geological samples, including marine ferromanganese crusts, ferromanganese nodules, single-grain zircon crystals with magnetite inclusions, fault gauge samples, stalagmites with ultra-low magnetizations, ultramafic rocks containing strong magnetic minerals. In this paper, we detail the improvements made to the system and developments of measurement and post-processing software. We improved the implementation and the electrical connection of a SQUID chip on a sapphire rod. A new electrical connection combines aluminum wire bonding and silver paste, ensuring stable and low contact resistance across cooling cycles leading to constant sensitivity and stability of measurements. For the improved system, the shortest sensor-to-sample distance was measured at approximately 125 µm using a precision line current. Electromagnetic shielding and improvements on grounding were made, which contributed to improved signal-to-noise ratios. The introduction of the reference sensor allows subtraction of environmental magnetic field. The new feature of stacking at each measurement grid is effective in reducing noise for weakly magnetized samples. Additionally, the post-processing software has been developed. Various drift correction algorithms provide flexibility to the operator to deal with the situation including a narrow marginal area or a dirty marginal area contaminated with magnetic materials. Spike noises could be removed by median filter, and flux jumps could be corrected by another independent algorithm. Dipole fitting allows the operator to calculate the position, intensity, and direction of a dipole one by one. A list of dipoles is made, which could be subtracted from the magnetic images to clean up for further analyses. Upward continuation enables leveling of the magnetic images measured with different sensor-to-sample distances allowing meaningful comparison and subtraction between different demagnetization steps. Calculation of X- and Y-components from Z-component allows to obtain total magnetic field image, which could be used to locate magnetized materials easily."

    "title": "Detection of slow slip event lasting several months in the shallow region of the Suruga Trough, the eastern end of the Nankai Trough, Japan",
    "abstract": "Numerous deep short-term slow slip events (S-SSEs) and long-term slow slip events (L-SSEs) have been detected in the Nankai Trough subduction zone in southwestern Japan based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. Recently, slow slip events (SSEs) lasting several months, which are significantly longer than typical deep S-SSEs but similar to or shorter than L-SSEs, have been reported near the trench, particularly off the Kii Peninsula in the central Nankai Trough. To investigate whether similar SSEs occur in the shallow region of the Suruga Trough, the easternmost segment of the Nankai Trough, we analyzed changes in GNSS baseline lengths between stations on the upper and lower plates across the Suruga Trough. To identify the timing of baseline shortening, we first converted the GNSS baseline length time series into velocity time series. We then compared these velocity time series with the correlation coefficients computed between the observed data and a template function representing baseline shortening associated with shallow SSEs. As a result, a signal corresponding to a plausible SSE in late 2019, whose duration can be approximately represented by 118 days, was detected at multiple GNSS stations near Omaezaki. A Bayesian inversion of the fault slip distribution estimated a maximum slip on the order of 10 mm at depths shallower than ~ 10 km on the shallow plate boundary off Omaezaki. This result was consistent across all three assumed plate interface models. Furthermore, slip extending to the trench was also inferred. The estimated moment magnitude (Mw) was approximately 5.5–5.6. This SSE coincided with an increase in small repeating earthquake activity on the deeper side. The discovery of a months-long SSE in the shallow region of the Suruga Trough suggests that SSEs with significantly longer durations than typical deep S-SSEs may be a widespread characteristic of the shallow Nankai Trough subduction zone. Moreover, by relaxing the detection criteria and considering smaller possible SSEs, the results further imply that such events may occur at intervals of approximately 500 days."

    "title": "Identification of traditional flood control facilities concealed in the riparian forest: a case study of the Echi River, central Japan",
    "abstract": "Unprecedented climate change has intensified flooding globally, with Japan experiencing frequent annual flood events. Traditional flood control facilities (TFCFs), levees made of stone, have historically played a crucial role in mitigating flood risks, supporting livelihoods, and enhancing local ecosystems. However, urbanization and the loss of floodplain functionality have contributed to the physical degradation and erosion of TFCFs. The rediscovery and evaluation of these structures are crucial for preserving cultural heritage, informing climate adaptation strategies, and enhancing disaster resilience. This study develops an integrated methodology to identify and analyze the Saruo structure, a type of TFCF, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. A multidisciplinary approach was employed, integrating UAV-LiDAR, UAV-SfM, old maps, field surveys, and interviews. A high-definition digital terrain model (DTM) was developed to detect convex landforms consistent with Saruo. An 1874 historical map confirmed their spatial distribution, while field surveys and interviews provided complementary insights into their physical characteristics and historical functions. The findings revealed that some Saruo structures have undergone significant transformations owing to flooding, vegetation encroachment, and urban development, while others have persisted despite environmental changes. Additionally, discrepancies between residents' recollections and modern landscapes highlight the limitations of memory-based reconstruction. Quantitatively capturing historical changes highlighted changes in the dimensions of Saruo owing to factors such as flooding, vegetation growth, and urban development. The results underscored the limitations of relying on individual methods while demonstrating the strengths of an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. This study emphasizes the potential of combining advanced remote sensing technologies with historical and community-based knowledge to rediscover and reinterpret forgotten TFCFs. Furthermore, this approach has broader applications for flood risk assessment, disaster education, and cultural heritage conservation."

    "title": "Dependence of the solar wind plasma density on moderate- and extremely high-geomagnetic activity elucidated by potential learning",
    "abstract": "In this study, the relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the K p index (2- to 5 + and 6- to 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm that emphasizes input parameters with the highest variance during training and identifies the most significant input parameters influencing the outputs based on a computed metric called “potentiality”. We focus on discussing the dependence of solar wind plasma density on moderate-geomagnetic conditions. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the K p level. Previously, PL extracted the solar wind velocity as the most predominant parameter at extremely low (0 to 1 +)- and high- K p ranges under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. Also in this study, the IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the OMNI solar wind database (1998–2019), corresponding from solar cycle 23 to beginning of cycle 25, were used as the input parameters. Again, PL selected the solar wind velocity as the most significant parameter for the moderate and extremely high K p levels. The potentiality of solar wind density for these K p ranges was, however, 3.5 times higher than that in the previous study, suggesting that its impact on geomagnetic activity cannot be ignored. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as the PL input data under all K p levels. At higher than the moderate K p level, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind velocity, if the plasma density is large, suggesting that not only solar wind velocity but also plasma density might significantly contribute to geomagnetic activity. These PL and incidental statistical investigations show that the solar wind density begins to regulate K p higher than moderate geomagnetic activity level under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions."

    "title": "Initial sea surface displacement of non-seismic tsunami associated with the 2020 sand point earthquake off the Alaska Peninsula",
    "abstract": "Large earthquakes occurred sequentially around a seismic gap of the Aleutian Trench, with a magnitude of 7.8 in July 2020, 7.6 in October 2020, and 8.2 in July 2021. The second earthquake generated a tsunami larger than expected based on its magnitude, implying the need for identifying additional tsunami sources rather than the sole use of fault motion. Therefore, we performed tsunami waveform inversions to estimate an initial sea surface displacement unrelated to the fault motion for the tsunami following the October 2020 earthquake. The inversion that assumed simultaneous generation of the non-seismic and seismic tsunamis did not yield a realistic initial sea surface displacement. The estimated initial sea surface displacement, assuming a 5-min delay of the non-seismic tsunami, showed a simple bipolar pattern with subsidence on the landward side and uplift on the trench side. Application of the empirical formula on the magnitude of submarine landslide and sea surface disturbance revealed that the inverted initial sea surface displacement required a significant submarine landslide with a thickness of ~ 500 m, length of ~ 8.0 km, width of ~ 60 km, and volume of ~ 120 km 3 . As several studies have indicated that past tsunamis were amplified by submarine landslides in the Aleutian Trench, the October 2020 earthquake likely generated submarine landslides and the unexpected large tsunami."

    "title": "Elastic properties of rocks from the seismogenic zone and minimum fault size to nucleate megathrust earthquakes",
    "abstract": "The elastic properties of rocks in subduction zones are indicators of the stress states and determine the critical length required for earthquake nucleation. We measured the elastic properties of core samples collected from the Susaki area in the Shimanto accretionary complex in southwestern (SW) Japan, which was exhumed from the seismogenic zone depths. We found that the samples have P-wave velocities of 5.1–5.4 (dry) and 5.4–5.8 km/s (wet), S-wave velocities of 3.2–3.3 (dry) and 3.0–3.3 km/s (wet), and porosities of 1.0–2.5%. According to microstructural observations, tight contact among grains owing to the pressure solution and cementation processes may lead to low porosity and high velocity. We examined relationships between velocity and porosity using rock physics models and found the potential of the model to describe the elastic properties of rocks from shallow to deep depths toward the seismogenic zone. The obtained elastic properties were used to estimate the critical nucleation length for a megathrust earthquake along a plate boundary fault. The estimated critical nucleation length for a megathrust earthquake is less than a few meters, even when the pore fluid pressure is higher than the hydrostatic pressure. This length can be a key parameter for examining the factors controlling nucleation processes in the seismogenic zone."

    "title": "Terrestrial vegetation and climate patterns during the dark layer depositions in the Japan Sea based on a pollen record from the KR07-12 PC-07 in the last glacial–interglacial cycle",
    "abstract": "We revealed terrestrial vegetation and climate patterns during the dark layer depositions in the Japan Sea, which probably reflect millennial-scale East Asian Monsoon fluctuations, based on a new pollen record from the KR07-12 PC-07 core in the southern central part of the Japan Sea. Total pollen concentrations in dark layers show relatively high amounts. Conversely, concentrations in light layers are quite low and likely influenced by changes in transportation and deposition processes associated with atmospheric or oceanic conditions. The fossil pollen assemblages in dark layers of the PC-07 core show similar patterns to those of the terrestrial pollen record from Lake Biwa, whereas pollen depositions from northeastern Asia were likely higher during the glacial periods. Japanese vegetation is likely the primary pollen source at the PC-07 site, especially within dark layers during MIS 5 and 3, because the dominant pollen taxa in the core are Japanese cedar and Japanese beech, which are endemic tree species. We recognize two types of pollen compositions in dark layers of the PC-07 core during MIS 5 and 3: Cryptomeria -dominant dark layers (Cry-DL) and temperate deciduous broadleaf-dominant dark layers (TDB-DL). The pollen record from the PC-07 core suggests that the regional climate conditions in western Japan were wet with a low seasonal contrast within Cry-DL during periods of smaller summer insolation and, in contrast, a relatively dry summer and dry winter within TDB-DL during periods of larger summer insolation."

    "title": "Applicability of low-temperature thermochronology to the evolution of young (< ~ 5 Ma) orogenic systems: a case study from the Japanese Islands",
    "abstract": "Low-temperature thermochronology, including fission track (FT) and (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronometry, has been widely used to constrain the exhumation history of orogenic systems over timescales of 10 6 –10 8 years. This research employed simple numerical modeling to evaluate the applicability of low-temperature thermochronometry to young orogenic systems uplifted in geologically recent periods such as the Pliocene and Quaternary, such as those in the Japanese Islands. Such orogenic systems are at the younger limit of the applicability because this time scale corresponds to the younger limit of applicability of the major low-temperature thermochronometers and also corresponds to the minimum period required for an orogenic system to be denuded by more than ~ 2–3 km after the start of uplift, which is the lower limit detectable by the major low-temperature thermochronometers. Time‒temperature paths were generated for varying uplift rates, uplift onsets, and model onsets (equivalent to the rock formation age). These paths were then converted into cooling ages for four thermochronometers: apatite and zircon FT and (U–Th–Sm)/He dating. The calculations were conducted using two models: a constant-elevation model and an increasing-elevation model. The modeling results are summarized in look-up tables, illustrating relationships between uplift rates, uplift onsets, rock formation ages and ratios of cooling age and rock formation age. The results indicate that differences in formation age and elevation change minimally impact cooling ages. The modeled dates generally align with measured cooling ages in regions where the rate and timing of uplift are well constrained, supporting the reliability of the modeling approach. Consequently, the derived relationships between uplift rates and cooling ages provide a practical method for roughly classifying mountain uplift rates based on cooling ages, without requiring complex simulations. Finally, these relationships were applied to previously reported cooling ages to visualize the distribution of uplift rates across the Japanese Islands over the past few million years. These results provide a benchmark for the low-temperature thermochronological studies, not only in the Japanese Islands, but also in mobile belts around the world that have begun to uplift in the past few million years."

    "title": "Coal-measure tight sandstone reservoir evolution under the control of the depositional–diagenetic process of the Middle–Lower Jurassic Shuixigou Group in Taibei Sag, Turpan-Hami Basin, Northwest China",
    "abstract": "The previous studies on coal-measure tight sandstone reservoirs often focused on the single diagenetic evolution and pore structure characterization. The understanding of reservoir evolution under the comprehensive control of the sedimentary–diagenetic process was insufficient. In this paper, the coal-measure tight sandstone reservoir evolution mechanism under the control of the depositional–diagenetic process is studied through sequence stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrology, mineralogy, and geochemistry analysis. The study found that during the depositional process of coal-bearing strata, there were differences in sedimentary environments, sand body types, and coal-mud-sand combinations in different sedimentary stages. These differences result in different diagenetic evolution processes and ultimately different reservoir qualities. In general, the coal-bearing strata underwent a depositional evolution process from the lowstand filling stage to the lacustrine transgressive-maximum flooding stage, and finally highstand filling stage. In this process, sand-coal-mud combinations of thick coal-mud covering thick sand, thick coal-mud thin sand, and thick sand thin coal-mud are formed. The sedimentary environment and coal-mud-sand combination control the type and content of carbonate cement. In the rapid lacustrine transgressive-maximum flooding stage, with a reducing-high salinity sedimentary environment, strong organic matter fermentation leads to the production of large amounts of CO 2 and reducing metal cations. It is conducive to the formation of a large number of early carbonate cements (siderite and ankerite). And the fluids and substances often migrate from the thick coal seam to the underlying thick lowstand filling sandstone. That is the reason why carbonate cement of lowstand filling sandstone is dominated by siderite and ankerite. In the highstand filling stage, with an oxidized-low salinity sedimentary environment, ferro calcite is the main carbonate cement in tight sandstone. Overall, the lacustrine transgressive-maximum flooding sandstone has a fine grain size and low content of rigid minerals, resulting in strong compaction and weak dissolution. And there is a large amount of siderite and ankerite developed. The reservoir quality is poor. Sandstones in lowstand and highstand filling stages have a coarse grain size and high content of rigid minerals, resulting in good pore preservation and strong dissolution. The reservoir quality is good. Siderite and ankerite are developed in reservoirs of lowstand filling stage. Due to the dissolution of early carbonate cements, its pores are particularly well preserved."

    "abstract": "The miniRAD radiometer is one of the payloads of the Idefix rover on the MMX mission to Phobos. It is a multispectral instrument which measures the infrared radiative flux in six wavelength channels between 4.7 and 100 µm using single-element thermopile detectors. MiniRAD is equipped with optical filters, one centered at 5.5 µm, three narrow bandpass filters at 8.3 µm, 8.9 µm, and 9.5 µm and two longpass filters with cut-ons at 14–15 µm. One of the longpass filters made from boron nitride (BN) is especially optimized for very low flux, being sensitive in the very long wavelength region even beyond 50 µm. The main measurement objective of the miniRAD instrument is the determination of Phobos’ surface brightness temperature during nighttime, from which the thermal inertia of the surface can be derived. Secondary objectives are to provide constraints on the slope of the emissivity in the thermal infrared, the location of the Christiansen feature, and the surface roughness of Phobos. MiniRAD has been calibrated radiometrically under relevant environmental conditions using a cavity blackbody over the full expected range of object temperatures from 100 to 330 K. The predicted uncertainty of the brightness temperature is < 1 K at dayside temperatures > 270 K for all channels, while the BN filter uncertainty is < 5 K at the lowest calibration temperature of 100 K."

    "title": "High-pressure and temperature investigation of silicic acid ± water with implications for the ice polymorphism, lunar moganite and diamonds growth media",
    "abstract": "Abstract The polymorphism of ice has been widely investigated over the last decades, and the results were found to be applicable over a wide range of terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments with recent findings also among the mineral inclusions entrapped in natural diamonds. In this study, we investigated the behavior of solid [SiO x (OH) 4-2x ] n silicic acid under anhydrous and hydrous conditions at high pressure and temperature using the diamond anvil cell technique combined with both Raman and Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy. Firstly, we report the stability of silicic acid in the form of silica gel under anhydrous conditions up to about 7 GPa and 200 °C. In the presence of water employed as pressure medium, we observe the formation of ice VI and ice VII at lower pressures than previously reported in pure water systems. Each phase transition is documented by the optical images over compression/decompression and heating/cooling runs. Importantly, we report the decomposition of silicic acid to moganite and metastable quartz in the presence of ice polymorphs up to near 10 GPa and 200 °C and also recovered at ambient conditions along with H 2 O liq . Main implications from this study span from planetary sciences to Earth’s deep mineralogy. For instance, the interior of ice giants might need to be revisited considering our enhanced stability of ice VII at lower pressures in the presence of tiny amount of free silica while the formation of moganite + quartz resembles the assemblage found in a lunar meteorite and provides a pressure–temperature range applicable to constrain impact conditions. Furthermore, the stability of silicic acid at high pressure(–temperature) can be taken as preliminary evidence that the formation of orthosilicic acid, such as that found around minerals entrapped in diamonds, might result from the dissolution of minerals (or melts) into acidic aqueous fluids."

    "title": "Philippine Sea Plate inception, evolution, and consumption with special emphasis on the early stages of Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction",
    "abstract": "We compiled the most relevant data acquired throughout the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) from the early expeditions to the most recent. We also analyzed the various explanatory models in light of this updated dataset. The following main conclusions are discussed in this study. (1) The Izanagi slab detachment beneath the East Asia margin around 60–55 Ma likely triggered the Oki-Daito plume occurrence, Mesozoic proto-PSP splitting, shortening and then failure across the paleo-transform boundary between the proto-PSP and the Pacific Plate, Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction initiation and ultimately PSP inception. (2) The initial splitting phase of the composite proto-PSP under the plume influence at ∼ 54–48 Ma led to the formation of the long-lived West Philippine Basin and short-lived oceanic basins, part of whose crust has been ambiguously called “fore-arc basalts” (FABs). (3) Shortening across the paleo-transform boundary evolved into thrusting within the Pacific Plate at ∼ 52–50 Ma, allowing it to subduct beneath the newly formed PSP, which was composed of an alternance of thick Mesozoic terranes and thin oceanic lithosphere. (4) The first magmas rising from the shallow mantle corner, after being hydrated by the subducting Pacific crust beneath the young oceanic crust near the upper plate spreading centers at ∼ 49–48 Ma were boninites. Both the so-called FABs and the boninites formed at a significant distance from the incipient trench, not in a fore-arc position as previously claimed. The magmas erupted for 15 m.y. in some places, probably near the intersections between back-arc spreading centers and the arc. (5) As the Pacific crust reached greater depths and the oceanic basins cooled and thickened at ∼ 44–45 Ma, the composition of the lavas evolved into high-Mg andesites and then arc tholeiites and calc-alkaline andesites. (6) Tectonic erosion processes removed about 150–200 km of frontal margin during the Neogene, consuming most or all of the Pacific ophiolite initially accreted to the PSP. The result was exposure of the FABs, boninites, and early volcanics that are near the trench today. (7) Serpentinite mud volcanoes observed in the Mariana fore-arc may have formed above the remnants of the paleo-transform boundary between the proto-PSP and the Pacific Plate."

    "title": "Long-term continuous observations of the horizontal inhomogeneity in lower-atmospheric water vapor concentration using A-SKY/MAX-DOAS",
    "abstract": "We conducted long-term (2017–2022) continuous observations of water vapor concentration in the lower atmosphere (0–1 km) over Tsukuba and Chiba, Japan, using the multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technique within the framework of the international Air Quality and Sky Research Remote Sensing Network (A-SKY). The accuracy of MAX-DOAS-derived lower-atmospheric water vapor concentration was validated against radiosonde measurements in Tsukuba (sample size = 1203), yielding a strong correlation ( R = 0.971), thereby confirming the reliability of this method. Additionally, we demonstrated the capability of a four-azimuth-viewing MAX-DOAS system, comprising four A-SKY/MAX-DOAS instruments, to capture horizontal inhomogeneities in lower-atmospheric water vapor over Chiba. Analysis of the four directional data sets revealed a correlation between these inhomogeneities and atmospheric instability (increase in inhomogeneities during atmospheric instability). Under stable atmospheric conditions, the correlation coefficient between any two azimuths exceeded 0.95, whereas in unstable conditions, it decreased below 0.95 in all directions, occasionally dropping below 0.90. To further investigate this relationship, we identified 15 cases of significant horizontal inhomogeneity under unstable conditions, 10 of which coincided with the presence of a stationary front north of Chiba. Local analysis (LA) by the Japan Meteorological Agency indicated an inflow of warm, moist air toward the front, likely contributing to both the observed inhomogeneity and atmospheric instability. Additionally, while these inhomogeneities were captured by A-SKY/MAX-DOAS, they were not adequately detected in the lower-atmospheric LA, despite being within the error range of A-SKY/MAX-DOAS. This highlights the critical role of A-SKY/MAX-DOAS in monitoring lower-atmospheric inhomogeneities that conventional LA has underestimated."

    "abstract": "A CNES/DLR rover called IDEFIX will be deployed on the surface of Phobos in late 2028 or early 2029 as part of JAXA’s Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission. The goal of the rover is to travel across the surface of Phobos for at least 100 days, with autonomous guidance provided by the navigation cameras (a stereo pair). By taking stereoscopic images of the area around IDEFIX up to the horizon (resolution of a few millimeters at 1 m), the navigation cameras aim to provide answers to a number of scientific questions, such as the origin of the color dichotomy, the nature of space weathering processes, and the extent of dust transport and exogenous contamination on Phobos. Here we present the IDEFIX navigation cameras, including their ground calibrations, and the science questions they are intended to address. We also present the architecture of the data processing pipeline being developed at the Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille to address the science objectives of the navigation cameras."

    "title": "Marine microplastics as vectors of major ocean pollutants and its hazards to the marine ecosystem and humans",
    "abstract": "Microplastic pollutes water, land, air, and groundwater environments not only visually but also ecologically for plants, animals, and humans. Microplastic has been reported to act as vectors by sorbing pollutants and contributing to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, particularly in marine ecosystems, organisms, and subsequently food webs. The inevitable exposure of microplastic to humans emphasises the need to review the potential effects, exposure pathways, and toxicity of microplastic toward human health. Therefore, this review was aimed to reveal the risks of pollutant sorption and bioaccumulation by microplastic toward humans, as well as the dominant types of pollutants sorbed by microplastic, and the types of pollutants that are bioaccumulated by microplastic in the living organisms of the marine ecosystem. The possible factors influencing the sorption and bioaccumulation of pollutants by microplastic in marine ecosystems were also reviewed. The review also revealed the prevailing types of microplastic, abundance of microplastic, and geographical distribution of microplastic in the aquatic environment globally. The literature review revealed that microplastic characteristics, chemical interactions, and water properties played a role in the sorption of pollutants by microplastic. The evidence of microplastic posing a direct medical threat to humans is still lacking albeit substantial literature has reported the health hazards of microplastic-associated monomers, additives, and pollutants. This review recommends future research on the existing knowledge gaps in microplastic research, which include the toxicity of microplastic, particularly to humans, as well as the factors influencing the sorption and bioaccumulation of pollutants by microplastic."

    "abstract": "IDEFIX, the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission Phobos rover, will be the first of its kind to attempt wheeled-locomotion on a low-gravity surface. The IDEFIX WheelCams, two cameras placed on the underside of the rover looking at the rover wheels, provide a unique opportunity to study the surface properties of Phobos, regolith behaviour on small-bodies and rover mobility in low-gravity. The information gained about Phobos’ surface will be of high importance to the landing and sampling operations of the main MMX spacecraft, in addition to being valuable for understanding the surface processes and geological history of Phobos. Here we introduce the WheelCam science objectives, the instrument and the characterisation activities. We also discuss the on-going preparations linked to the analysis and interpretation of the WheelCam images on the surface of Phobos."

    "title": "Soil salinity assessment by using near-infrared channel and Vegetation Soil Salinity Index derived from Landsat 8 OLI data: a case study in the Tra Vinh Province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam",
    "abstract": "Salinity intrusion is a pressing issue in the coastal areas worldwide. It affects the natural environment and causes massive economic loss due to its impacts on the agricultural productivity and food safety. Here, we assessed the salinity intrusion in the Tra Vinh Province, in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Landsat 8 OLI image was utilized to derive indices for soil salinity estimate including the single bands, Vegetation Soil Salinity Index (VSSI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI). Statistical analysis between the electrical conductivity (EC 1:5 , dS/m) and the environmental indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI image was performed. Results indicated that spectral values of near-infrared (NIR) band and VSSI were better correlated with EC 1:5 ( r 2 = 0.8 and r 2 = 0.7, respectively) than the other indices. Comparative results show that soil salinity derived from Landsat 8 was consistent with in situ data with coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.96 dS/m for NIR band and R 2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 1.27 dS/m for VSSI index. Findings of this study demonstrate that Landsat 8 OLI images reveal a high potential for spatiotemporally monitoring the magnitude of soil salinity at the top soil layer. Outcomes of this study are useful for agricultural activities, planners, and farmers by mapping the soil salinity contamination for better selection of accomodating crop types to reduce economical loss in the context of climate change. Our proposed method that estimates soil salinity using satellite-derived variables can be potentially useful as a fast-approach to detect the soil salinity in the other regions with low cost and considerable accuracy."

    "title": "Tracing early life on Mars: lessons from organics produced in high-altitude hotsprings of Ladakh",
    "abstract": "Hotspring waters have traditionally been recognized for their therapeutic benefits. More recently, high-altitude hotsprings have received attention for astrobiological studies because they replicate several parameters of extreme conditions that once occurred on early Mars. Investigation of such hotspring environments can provide us with more relevant biomarker tools to study the search for possible extinct life on Mars that existed in similar environments. This study presents the first qualitative data (semiquantitative) on organic compounds’ origin and distribution in Ladakh’s high-altitude hotspring waters. The study was conducted on the Chumathang, Panamik, Changlung, and Puga hotspring sites with thermal water temperatures and pH ranging from 50.4° to 84.9 °C and 7.01 to 8.08, respectively. These sites were dominated by bacterially produced organic compounds, mainly n-alkanes, esters, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and alkenes. Non-distinguishable thermogenic abiotic organic compounds may represent a minor fraction of low molecular weight n-alkanes (C12 and C14). A semiquantitative understanding of organic compounds based on peak area percentage exhibits that larger proportions of organic compounds in the thermal waters of these sites were dominated by a diverse range of bioactive compounds in response to various extreme environmental factors. Compared to the low-altitude hotspring waters, the high-altitude hotspring waters contain a significantly higher number of bioactive compounds. These compounds are stable both chemically and physically in the extreme environments commonly found in high-altitude hydrothermal environments, which makes them promising candidates as biomarkers for the search for early life in Mars’ hydrothermal deposits."

    "abstract": "Isotopes in precipitation are valuable for tracking water cycles and material transport. Given increasing demand for dynamic models that simulate isotopic variations on daily or shorter timescales, this study aims to enhance an isoscape model with day-to-day variability by incorporating detailed evaporative isotopic processes. Here, we conduct hourly simulations using four reanalysis datasets (JRA-3Q, JRA-55, ERA5, and MERRA-2) for the period from 1996 to 2003. The daily- and event-based outputs are validated using observed isotopic data from maritime (Kanto Plain), intermediate (North China Plain), and continental (Mongolian Plateau) climate regions. The simulations generally captured the observed variations, with the highest accuracy in the Kanto Plain (root-mean-square error = 1.61‰ for δ 18 O). However, the accuracy is relatively low in the other two areas due to strong influences of uncertainties in soil and groundwater isotopes on precipitation isoscapes. The reproducibility of the d-excess is lower than that of the δ values, with raindrop evaporation having a heavy influence. These findings demonstrate that interdiurnal isotopic variation in precipitation is strongly influenced by both atmospheric water vapor transport/condensation and evaporation from the Earth’s surface and raindrops. Thus, better parameterizations of isotopic fractionation during evaporation would improve the reproducibility of precipitation isoscapes with day-to-day variability."

    "title": "Microgravity penetrometry flight campaign in support of MMX sampler science exploitation",
    "abstract": "Characterising the mechanical properties of minor bodies is essential for understanding their origin and evolution. Past missions such as Hayabusa2 have landed on asteroids to sample and discover what these bodies are made of. However, there has been conflicting evidence and reports into the physical properties of the granular surface material of these bodies. With future missions such as Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency’s Martian Moons eXploration mission landing on Phobos, the understanding and identification of these physical properties is crucial to maximising the scientific output from these missions. Penetrometry, the determination of the reaction force that an object experiences as it penetrates a surface, can help to understand the essential properties of regolith, such as grain size, porosity and cohesion. Results of penetrometry experiments are largely analysed based on empirical models, which presents us with a challenge if we want to apply them to understand granular materials on asteroid surfaces because gravity cannot be eliminated in the laboratory. Hence, it is essential to verify penetrometry as a method and validate penetrometry instrument designs in microgravity. For this purpose, we conducted a microgravity experiment onboard a parabolic flight campaign. Our experiment tested the use of penetrometry in asteroid-analogue environments by investigating samples with varying properties, such as grain size distribution and shape, and then compared to 1 g experiments to understand the role microgravity plays. The experiment provided a substantial database for future analysis. This paper will focus on the design of the experiment and the parabolic flight campaign in which the experiments were conducted. The design decisions and the variables adjusted during the experiment will be discussed, evaluating how these influenced the campaign and its outcomes. We will also provide a snapshot of preliminary results of the data captured during this experiment. For example, we show the effect of cohesion on penetrometer reaction force, with more cohesive materials providing larger reaction forces nearly of the same magnitude of their 1 g counterparts. We also show that penetrometer tip shapes provide different reaction forces and that flat tips provide the largest reaction force compared to the others. The influence of penetration velocity will be investigated further with the aid of theoretical models. Early indications from the results seen so far are promising for future analyses and will provide key information for the analysis of penetrometry data on future missions."

    "abstract": "This article reviews the outcomes of a three-year project utilizing \"Fugaku,\" Japan's flagship supercomputer, to conduct high-resolution ensemble simulations using atmosphere or atmosphere–ocean coupled models for both the Japan region and the entire globe. The project name was \"Large Ensemble Atmospheric and Environmental Prediction for Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.\" The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of numerical weather forecasting and provide probabilistic prediction information. To address the increasing severity of extreme weather events associated with global warming, such as torrential rainfall and tropical cyclones, high-resolution large-number ensemble atmospheric forecasting experiments have been conducted across timescales ranging from a few minutes to several weeks, extending to seasonal scales. This project aims to investigate advanced methodology using high-performance computing that provides probabilistic forecasts with sufficient lead time for effective disaster prevention and mitigation. Three sub-themes are explored: 1. meso-scale and regional modeling studies; 2. global and seasonal to sub-seasonal studies; and 3. innovative approaches to environmental studies. Central to this effort are high-resolution simulations that accurately represent cumulonimbus clouds and meso-scale systems, which are crucial for predicting severe weather phenomena alongside improved initial conditions derived from observational big data. These advancements are essential for predicting meteorological disasters caused by extreme events. Furthermore, the integration of probability information with improved accuracy significantly enhances disaster risk management, thereby increasing the practical utility of forecasts. This research also aims to develop pioneering innovative numerical weather and atmospheric environment forecasting technologies by incorporating big data from trace gas observations in addition to conventional meteorological data."

    "title": "Natural and continental influence on aerosol distributions over the northwestern Pacific Ocean in the late winter and early spring of 2021",
    "abstract": "Aerosols have substantial impacts on climate change and marine ecosystems over the northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO); however, their spatiotemporal variability and characteristics have not been sufficiently characterized especially in the East Asian winter monsoon. The compositions and physical parameters of fine-mode aerosols over the NWPO were investigated during a cruise on the research vessel Mirai in the late winter and early spring of 2021. Ship-based high-temporal resolution observations and laboratory analyses of aerosol number concentrations and chemical and elemental compositions revealed the diverse sources and transport processes significantly affecting the behavior of fine-mode aerosol particles in the marine boundary layer (MBL) over the NWPO. The number concentrations of aerosol particles with mobility diameters greater than 100 nm, which were used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), were generally positively correlated with black carbon and sulfate concentrations throughout the cruise, indicating that even in remote oceans, higher CCN number concentrations were significantly associated with non-natural sources. Latitudinal contrasts in fine-mode aerosol compositions were observed between the subarctic (> 35°N) and subtropical (< 30°N) regions. In the subarctic region, sea-salt (SS) aerosols were dominant in fine-mode mass under windy conditions (up to approximately 30 m s −1 ) and their mass concentration variations were well explained by the MBL structure and wind–wave conditions. In the subtropical regions, in contrast, the CCN proxy number concentrations and mass concentrations of non-SS aerosols (sulfate, carbonaceous, and metallic components) were elevated due to synoptic-scale transport of continental air masses. As ammonium sulfate was a dominant component in the subtropical regions over the NWPO, the observed enhancement of aerosol concentrations substantially impacted CCN concentrations in this region where is far (1000–1500 km) from continental source regions in Southeast and East Asia. Additionally, volcanic emissions of sulfur compounds contributed significantly to the enhancement of sulfate aerosol mass and particle number concentrations near Nishinoshima, which was not in an eruptive state during the cruise. These results highlight the significances and further requirements of in situ ship-based characterizations to better understand aerosol physicochemical properties and processes, such as sea-spraying emission, in the MBL over the NWPO."

The slant range continuously measured by the LIDAR is used for the correction of the local topography and the orbit and attitude of the spacecraft. The channel and gain setting of the LIDAR in the proximity phase will be automatically controlled based on the received energy. This paper reports the result of ground-based calibration tests. The calibration function is obtained for each channel and gain settings. Then, the performance test of the auto gain control function is carried out by changing the received energy gradually. This test demonstrates that the automatic gain control system of the LIDAR works well and the obtained slant range and received energy change smoothly."

Nine models submitted simulation output for a 40-day (1 August–10 September 2016) intercomparison period. Eight of these employed a tiling of the sphere that was uniformly less than 5 km. By resolving the transient dynamics of convective storms in the tropics, global storm-resolving models remove the need to parameterize tropical deep convection, providing a fundamentally more sound representation of the climate system and a more natural link to commensurately high-resolution data from satellite-borne sensors. The models and some basic characteristics of their output are described in more detail, as is the availability and planned use of this output for future scientific study. Tropically and zonally averaged energy budgets, precipitable water distributions, and precipitation from the model ensemble are evaluated, as is their representation of tropical cyclones and the predictability of column water vapor, the latter being important for tropical weather."

    "title": "Energy dissipation caused by impact or slow compression of dust aggregates consisting of fibers",
    "abstract": "In the process of planetesimal formation, the mechanical properties of highly porous dust aggregates play a key role. However, it has not been easy to form highly porous dust aggregates in laboratory experiments. To solve this problem, we produce dust aggregates consisting of fibrous monomers. Specifically, silk fibers are entangled in the turbulent flow made by a vacuum cleaner. As a result, the solid fraction of the produced dust aggregates shows \\(\\phi \\simeq 10^{-3}\\) for all aggregate samples. This value is much smaller than the dust aggregates consisting of grain monomers. To characterize the mechanical properties of this new type of dust aggregate, we perform a simple free-fall impact experiment on a hard floor and a static compression test, under the effect of Earth gravity. The coefficient of restitution (COR) of centimeter-scale dust aggregates with an impact velocity ( \\(\\sim 1\\) m \\(\\hbox {s}^{-1})\\) is measured based on the image analysis of the impact-and-rebound movies. We find that the measured COR is almost constant, \\(\\sim\\) 0.1–0.2. Regarding the compression test, dust aggregates are slowly compressed up to 4–6 mN compression force and then slowly decompressed. In this cyclic compression test, the hysteretic behavior of the compression force is observed. From these two observations, we estimate the degree of energy dissipation in the deformed highly porous dust aggregates consisting of fibers. The obtained result implies that fibrous dust could be a useful model for experimentally mimicking highly porous dust aggregates. Namely, the fibrous aggregates can offer valuable insights for estimating the timescale of planetesimal formation and so on, in future studies."

    "title": "Nitrogen and carbon isotopic relationships in the diet and eye lenses of chub mackerel revealed in a laboratory rearing experiment",
    "abstract": "The N and C isotopic compositions (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) of phytoplankton vary due to biogeochemical processes. The δ 15 N and δ 13 C values of fish tissue are inherited from the phytoplankton in the regions where the fish lived. The δ 15 N and δ 13 C values of fish eye lenses, which are an incrementally growing tissue, have shown promise for reconstructing migration routes and feeding environments over the entire life of a fish. We conducted a laboratory rearing experiment of chub mackerel fed isotopically different diets from hatching to the juvenile stage for 100 d. The nascent fiber cells in the eye lenses were sampled at each growth stage, and mature fiber cells in the lenses at ages of 60 and 100 d were delaminated. The δ 15 N and δ 13 C values of these tissues and the δ 15 N values of individual amino acids were measured. The temporal changes in the δ 15 N and δ 13 C values of laminae in mature fiber cells in mackerel eye lenses were consistent with those of the nascent fiber cells at each age, and with the diet values corrected by trophic discrimination factors (TDFs). The TDFs for N and C in the mackerel eye lenses were 2.8–3.4‰ and 2.1–2.6‰, respectively. A model simulation revealed that it requires 191 d for the eye lenses in fish that switched diets at 60 d of age to reach the observed TDF for N of 3.1‰, and that the eye lenses of the adults take longer to reach isotopic equilibrium than the eye lenses of actively growing juveniles. These results suggest that the δ 15 N values of phytoplankton in the regions where chub mackerel grew can be reconstructed with about six months of time integration from the δ 15 N values of laminae in eye lenses based on the TDF correction for N in eye lenses. In addition, the TDFs for phenylalanine of − 0.8‰ to 0.2‰ suggest that the δ 15 N values of phytoplankton in the mackerel nursery areas can be approximated from the δ 15 N values of phenylalanine in mackerel eye lenses. The establishment of an iso-logging method using eye lenses has the potential to reconstruct the migration routes of all species of eyed organisms on Earth."

    "title": "Textural evolution of S-type micrometeorites",
    "abstract": "Cosmic dust, the dominant extraterrestrial material entering Earth's atmosphere, undergoes textural transformation during entry. This study investigates the dependence of texture on entry conditions and classifies textures like barred (tabular, platy, and radial) and porphyritic (equant, skeletal, and chain). Texture development hinges on the balance between overheating and undercooling. Particles heated below the liquidus form scoriaceous or equant porphyritic textures. Near-liquidus temperatures yield skeletal morphologies, while exceeding the liquidus by ~ 50 °C produces chain forms. At ~ 100 °C above the liquidus, embryo distortion leads to barred textures, whose type depends on undercooling. Further heating produces cryptocrystalline, glass, and CAT (calcium–aluminium–titanium) spherules. Above 2400 °C, ablation exceeds 90% and hindering spherule formation. Additionally, comparing chondritic olivine liquidus and micrometeoroid residual melt compositions with particle heating temperatures reveals the degree of overheating and identifies entry conditions favouring specific textures. Particles with a size of 400 µm and smaller entering at escape velocity with higher zenith angles (65°–90° for CI and 80°–90° for CV, CM, L, LL, and H precursors) can survive unmelted or form scoriaceous or porphyritic spherules. Barred textures are likely for smaller particles (< 400 µm) entering at escape velocity with moderate zenith angles (50°–70°). Steeper angles, larger sizes, and higher velocities favour glass formation. This work refines our understanding of entry conditions that shape micrometeorite textures."

    "title": "Carnivorous plants: unveiling trophic identity and advanced nitrogen acquisition strategies",
    "abstract": "Carnivorous and parasitic plants have captured attention not only for public but also for researchers for centuries. Instead of absorbing inorganic nitrogen from soils, they can obtain some or most of their nutrients from heterotrophic organisms. With such special strategies of ‘carnivory’ and ‘parasitism,’ they indeed successfully survive in oligotrophic conditions. However, the detailed mechanisms have remained unclear, in short, by which these unique plants may have multiple channels in the nitrogen acquisition from soils, insects, and/or mycorrhizal fungi. Here we use the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen within amino acids to characterize the trophic position (TP) and the nitrogen acquisition of these unique plants. The results show that carnivorous plants register at the TP of 2.1 ± 0.2, being consistent with the TP of organisms that feed on animal diets, while parasitic-mycoheterotrophic plants register at the TP of 1.0 ± 0.1, being identical to the TP of typical photoautotrophs such as modern plants. These trophic tendencies provide strong evidence for the presence of two types of trophic adaptation to oligotrophic conditions: Carnivorous plants directly absorb amino acids derived from insect preys through their carnivorous leaves, whereas parasitic-mycoheterotrophic plants absorb ammonium ion derived from mycorrhizal fungi through their roots. Our findings thus illuminate that there are multiple strategies for nitrogen acquisition among plants under oligotrophic conditions, which will help to clarify the classification of carnivorous and parasitic plants and to advance the knowledge of plant evolution in the earth history."

    "title": "New evaluation of vertical particulate organic carbon fluxes of submillimeter-sized phaeodarians in the mesopelagic twilight zone of the western North Pacific Ocean",
    "abstract": "The western subarctic North Pacific is one of the areas where substantial amounts of CO 2 are photosynthetically taken up and effectively transferred to the ocean interior. Phaeodarians (marine siliceous Rhizaria) have high biomass in the western North Pacific, but most quantitative studies of their carbon biomass and vertical carbon flux to the seafloor have been limited to phaeodarians larger than 500 µm. Here, we investigated the time-series flux of < 1 mm phaeodarian particles collected in a sediment trap deployed at a depth of 1000 m at Station K2 in the western North Pacific subarctic region from June 1, 2014 to July 6, 2015. We compared species-specific organic carbon content of phaeodarians in sediment trap samples measured using an ultra-sensitive elemental analyzer with that of living phaeodarians calculated using allometric carbon-to-volume relationships. This enabled us to estimate the remaining organic carbon content of all species of < 1 mm phaeodarians in sediment trap samples and quantified the < 1 mm phaeodarian organic carbon flux for the first time. The organic carbon flux of < 1 mm phaeodarians varied from 64 to 1364 µg m −2 d −1 during the sampling period, with a mean and standard deviation of 318 ± 266 µg m −2 d −1 . The average contribution rate to the organic carbon flux of < 1 mm phaeodarians was higher for deeper dwelling groups, with the lower intermediate dwellers (750–1000 m) accounting for 41.6%, while the surface to subsurface dwellers (0–250 m) accounted for only 0.3%. The contribution of the organic carbon flux of < 1 mm phaeodarians to that of total (sum of the < 1 mm and > 1 mm fractions) particulates ranged from 1.1% to 12.5%, with an average contribution of 3.5% during the sampling period, which was higher than the average contribution of 2.5% reported for > 1 mm phaeodarians in our previous study. The contribution of the organic carbon flux of total phaeodarians to that of total particulates ranged from 2.4 to 15.1%, with an average contribution of 6.0%. This study highlights the importance of quantifying both < 1 mm and > 1 mm phaeodarian organic carbon fluxes for understanding the marine carbon cycle."

    "abstract": "The contribution of subduction parameters, mantle flow, and magmatic systems to the triggering of ignimbrite flare-ups is poorly understood. A re-examination of spatiotemporal variations in igneous activity and Sr–Nd isotopic compositions through Cretaceous to Paleogene, based on a new dataset covering the Japan arc and the Korean Peninsula, shows the existence of two isotopically distinct mantle sources with SrI and εNd(t) higher and lower than 0.7065 and − 3.5, respectively. The more enriched mantle source was introduced into the mantle wedge at 100–60 Ma. The isotopic enrichment in magma in Japan arc peaked at 90–60 Ma, coinciding with the ignimbrite flare-up. This isotopic fluctuation can be explained by the passive upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle induced by the rollback of the flat-slab of the Panthalassa plate subducted beneath the North China Craton began with 150–140 Ma. Our dataset clearly shows that the increase in thermal input from the mantle to the lower crust of the Japan arc was the prime factor in the formation of world-class ignimbrite bodies."

Near the Japan Trench, historical outer-rise earthquakes (M8-class) that generated huge tsunamis had previously occurred after megathrust earthquakes. Following the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, there have been several outer-rise earthquakes in this area, including a few M7-class earthquakes. However, it is still unclear which faults are most likely to cause a major outer-rise earthquake. It is important to understand the geometry of the normal faults developing in the outer-rise as well as the development process and activity of the normal faults in terms of evaluating the risk of earthquake occurrence under current stress field. In this study, we use a method that evaluates the activity of normal faults with slip tendency calculated by stress field and fault geometry. The near-fault stress field was calculated from the earthquake focal mechanism, and the fault geometry was extracted from the seafloor bathymetry map and the 2D seismic sections after a time-to-depth conversion of time-migrated profiles. We calculated the slip tendency of normal faults developing in the outer-rise of the Japan Trench as one typical example. We found the slip tendency in the west-dipping faults to be significantly higher than that in the east-dipping faults. We also noticed older abyssal-hill faults show low activity. An area of low slip tendency faults is recognized around 38.8°–39°N near the Japan Trench, where the magnetic anomalies do not continue and fracture zone faults are developing. Based on the fault activity analysis, this study shows that the earthquake occurrence in the outer-rise of the Japan Trench is spatially heterogeneous, but more likely to occur on the west-dipping faults."

    "title": "Long-term and interannual variations of atmospheric methane observed by the NIES and collaborative observation networks",
    "abstract": "Effective action for climate change mitigation requires an accurate understanding of global greenhouse gas budgets, including those of methane (CH 4 ). Atmospheric measurement data provide key constraints for estimating the magnitudes and distributions of sources and sinks and are utilized in atmospheric chemistry transport modeling studies. Long-term atmospheric measurement networks have revealed decadal, interannual, and seasonal variations in atmospheric CH 4 . In 2020, a record-breaking annual CH 4 increase was recorded, but its cause is still unknown. This study analyzes atmospheric CH 4 variations using data from the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) and its collaborative observation networks. Datasets from ground, mobile, and satellite platforms, employing diverse measurement techniques, confirmed past episodes, recent remarkable increases, and spatial distributions of atmospheric CH 4 . Our data clearly showed a sustained CH 4 increase from 2020 to 2022, with the highest annual increase in 2021. The atmospheric CH 4 increase was pronounced in the northern mid-to-high latitudes in 2020, but the enhancement shifted south in 2021 and 2022. This study demonstrates the capability of observational data from the NIES and collaborative networks in accurately characterizing spatiotemporal variations in atmospheric CH 4 regularly, supporting the improvement of our estimates of the global CH 4 budget."

    "title": "Magnetic field experiment at Phobos and in space around Mars by the Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission",
    "abstract": "The mass spectrum analyzer (MSA) is one of the instruments onboard MMX and observes the interaction between the Martian moons (Phobos and Deimos) and the solar wind as well as the material transport between Mars and its moons. MSA consists of an ion mass spectrum analyzer and a magnetometer. The objective of the magnetometer, MSA-MG, is to measure the magnetic field at the MMX position to trace the motion of the ions. We defined the requirements for the performance of the MSA-MG and designed the instrument to meet them. It is confirmed that MSA-MG as a unit has the required characteristics by the ground performance test and calibration. One of the essential calibration parameters, artificial bias in the data, must be determined by analyzing the flight data. To improve the accuracy of the determined bias, efforts to remove the magnetic noise from other components onboard MMX are essential."
